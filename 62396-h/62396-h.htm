<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<blockquote>


<p><span class="figleft120"><img src="images/i_w.jpg" width="119" height="120" alt="" />&nbsp;</span> When this Collection was originally projected, it seemed so unlikely to receive much
support from the general public that it was intended to publish a few only of the best
Parodies of each author.</p>

<p>After the issue of the first few numbers, however, it became evident that "a hit&mdash;a palpable hit&mdash;"
had been made, the sale rapidly increased, and subscribers not only expressed their desire that
the collection should be made as nearly complete as possible, but by the loans of scarce books,
and copies of Parodies, helped to make it so.</p>

<p>This involved an alteration in the original arrangement, and as it would have been monotonous to
fill a whole number of sixteen pages with parodies of one short poem, such as those on "Excelsior,"
or Wolfe's Ode, it became necessary to spread them over several numbers. In the Index, which
has been carefully compiled, references will be found, under the titles of the original Poems,
to all the parodies mentioned. In all cases, where it has been possible to do so, full titles and
descriptions of the works quoted from, have been given; any omission to do this has been
unintentional, and will be at once rectified on the necessary information being supplied.</p>

<p>To the following gentlemen I am much indebted for assistance in the formation of this collection,
either by granting permission to quote from their works, or by their original contributions:&mdash;Messrs.
Lewis Carroll (author of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"), G. P. Beckley, James
Gordon, John Lane, J. W. Morris, Walter Parke (author of "The Lays of the Saintly"),
H. Cholmondeley Pennell (author of "Puck on Pegasus"), Major-General Rigaud, Edward
Simpson, G. R. Sims, Basil H. Soulsby, Edward Walford, M.A. (Editor of "The Antiquarian
Magazine"), J. W. Gleeson White, W. H. K. Wright, Public Library, Plymouth, and John Whyte,
Public Library, Inverness. A great deal of bibliographical information was sent me by my
late lamented friend, the learned and genial Mr. William Bates, Editor of "The Maclise Portrait
Gallery;" his brother, Mr. A. H. Bates; the Rev. T. W. Carson, of Dublin; and Miss Orton, have
also given me valuable assistance.</p>

<p>In a few cases where parodies are to be found in easily accessible works, extracts only have been
quoted, or references given; but it is intended in future, wherever permission can be obtained,
to give each parody in full, as they are found to be useful for public entertainments, and recitations.
When the older masters of our Literature are reached, a great deal of curious and amusing
information will be given, and it is intended to conclude with a complete bibliographical account
of P<span class="smcapa">ARODY</span>, with extracts and translations from all the principal works on the topic. Whilst
arranging the present volume, I have been gathering materials for those to come, which will
illustrate the works of those old writers whose names are familiar in our mouths as household
words. Much that is not only quaint and amusing will thus be collected, whilst many illustrations
of our literature, both in prose and verse, which are valuable to the student, will for the first time
be methodically arranged, annotated, and published in a cheap and accessible form.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="dropCap">I</span> HAVE, for many years past, been collecting Parodies of the works of the most celebrated British
and American Authors. This I have done, <em>not</em> because I entirely approve of the custom of
turning high-class work into ridicule, but because many of the parodies are in themselves works of
considerable literary merit. Moreover, as "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," so does a
parody show that its original has acquired a certain celebrity, for no author would waste his time, or
his talent, in composing a burlesque of an unknown, or obscure work.</p>

<p>Numerous articles on parodies are to be found scattered up and down in odd corners of old
magazines and reviews, a few small books have been written on the topic; but, until now, no attempt
has been made to give, in a connected form, a history of parody with examples and explanatory
notes.</p>

<p>This, then, is what I propose to do in the following articles, and those who desire to possess a
complete set of parodies on any favourite author, would do well to preserve these papers for future
reference.</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">ARODY</span> is a form of composition of a somewhat ungracious description, as it owes its very
existence to the work it caricatures; but it has some beneficial results in drawing our attention
to the defects of some authors, whose stilted language and grandiloquent phrases have veiled their
poverty of ideas, their sham sentiment, and their mawkish affectations.</p>

<p>The first attribute of a parody is that it should present a sharp contrast to the original either
in subject, or treatment of the subject; that if the original subject should be some lofty theme, the
parody may reduce it to a prosaic matter-of-fact narrative. If, on the other hand, the topic selected
be one of every day life, it may be made exceedingly amusing if described in high-flown mock heroic
diction. If the original errs in sentimental affectation, so much the better for the parodist. Thus
many of Tom Moore's best known songs are mere windy platitudes in very musical verse, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
afford excellent and legitimate materials for ridicule. The nearer the original diction is preserved, and
the fewer the alterations needed to produce a totally opposite meaning or ridiculous contrast, the
more complete is the antithesis, the more striking is the parody; take for instance Pope's well-known
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Here shall the Spring its earliest <em>sweets</em> bestow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Here the first <em>roses</em> of the year shall blow,"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which, by the alteration of two words only, were thus applied by Miss Katherine Fanshawe to the
Regent's Park when it was first opened to the public:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Here shall the Spring its earliest <em>coughs</em> bestow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Here the first <em>noses</em> of the year shall blow."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this happy parody we have that "union of remote ideas," which is said, and said truly, to
constitute the essence of wit. Even the most serious and religious works have been parodied, and by
authors of the highest position. Thus Luther mimicked the language of the Bible, and both Cavaliers
and Puritans railed at each other in Scriptural phraseology. The Church services and Litanies of both
the Catholic, and Protestant Churches, have served in turn as originals for many bitter satires and
lampoons, directed at one time against the Church and the priests, at another time in equally bitter
invective against their opponents.</p>

<p>To undertake the composition of parodies, as the word is generally comprehended&mdash;that is,
to make a close imitation of some particular poem, though it should be characteristic of the author&mdash;would
be at times rather a flat business. Even the Brothers Smith in "Rejected Addresses," and
Bon Gaultier in his "Ballads," admirable as they were, stuck almost too closely to their selected
models; and Phœbe Carey, who has written some of the best American parodies, did the same thing.
It is an evidence of a poet's distinct individuality, when he can be amusingly imitated. We can only
make those the object of our imitations whose manner, or dialect, stamps itself so deeply into our
minds that a new cast can be taken. But how could one imitate Robert Pollok's "Course of Time,"
or Young's "Night Thoughts," or Blair's "Grave," or any other of those masses of words, which are
too ponderous for poetry, and much too respectable for absurdity! Either extreme will do for a
parody, excellence or imbecility; but the original must at least have <em>a distinct, pronounced character</em>.</p>

<p>Certain well known poems are so frequently selected as models for parodies that it will only be
possible to select a few from the best of them; to re-publish every parody that has appeared on
Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade," E. A. Poe's "The Raven," Hamlet's Soliloquy, or
Longfellow's "Excelsior," would be a tedious, and almost endless task.</p>

<p>Prose parodies, though less numerous than those in verse, are often far more amusing, and it
will be found that Dr. Johnson's ponderous sentences, Carlyle's rugged eloquence, and Dickens'
playful humour and tender pathos, lend themselves admirably to parody.</p>

<p>The first portion of this work will be devoted to the parodies themselves, accompanied by short
notes sufficient to explain such allusions as may, in time, appear obscure; the second will contain a
full bibliographical account of all the principal collections of Parodies and Works on the subject, such as
the "Probationary Odes," Hone's Trials, the "Rejected Addresses," and the late M. Octave Delepierre's

account of old Greek and Roman, and of modern French and English Parodies. I had the pleasure of
supplying M. Delepierre with the materials for his chapter on English Parodies, but, owing to the
limited space at his command, he was only able to quote a verse or two of the best parody of each

<h2><a name="ALFRED_LORD_TENNYSON" id="ALFRED_LORD_TENNYSON"></a>Alfred Tennyson.</h2>

<p class="center"><em>Poet Laureate.</em></p>


<p>A<span class="smcapa">LFRED</span> T<span class="smcapa">ENNYSON</span>, the third of seven brothers,
was born August 5th, 1809, at Somersby, a small
village near Horncastle, in Lincolnshire. His
father, Dr. George Clayton Tennyson, was the
rector of this parish, he was a man remarkable
for his strength, stature, and varied attainments
as poet, painter, musician and linguist. In 1827,
Alfred Tennyson, with his elder brother Charles,
both then being scholars at the Louth Grammar
school, published a small volume entitled "Poems
by Two Brothers." Shortly afterwards, these two
brothers removed to Trinity College, Cambridge,
and in 1829, Alfred Tennyson obtained the
Chancellor's Gold Medal for his poem on "Timbuctoo."
His subsequent poetical works rapidly
attracted attention, and, on the death of William
Wordsworth, he was created Poet Laureate, the
Warrant being dated the 19th November, 1850.
As a poet he has achieved almost the highest
fame, but in his numerous efforts as a dramatist
he has been less successful.</p>

<p>For the consideration of the Parodies of
Tennyson's poems, they may conveniently be
divided into three periods, namely, his early
Poems, poems in connection with his appointment
in 1850 to the office of Poet Laureate, and
Poems since that date. Although Tennyson has
suppressed many of his early works, yet he
occasionally furbishes up, and re-issues as a
new poem some of his youthful compositions.</p>

<p>Fastidious as he is known to be in his selection
of what he thus re-publishes, it is still a matter
of some surprise that he should have entirely
suppressed his prize poem <em>Timbuctoo</em>, which
would always be of interest as a specimen of his
early work, and is, besides, far removed above the
average of Prize Poems.</p>

<p>The poems were sent in for competition in the
month of April, 1829; and on June 12, 1829, the
<cite>Cambridge Chronicle</cite> recorded that "On Saturday
last, the Chancellor's Gold Medal for the best
English poem by a resident undergraduate was
adjudged to Alfred Tennyson, of Trinity College."
Shortly afterwards the poem was published, and
was favourably reviewed in <em>The Athenæum</em>, which
speaking of Prize poems generally, stated,
"These productions have often been ingenious
and elegant, but we have never before seen one
of them which indicated really first-rate
poetical genius, and which would have done
honour to any man that ever wrote. <em>Such, we
do not hesitate to affirm, is the little work before
us.</em>"</p>

<p>W. M. Thackeray was at Cambridge at the
same time as Tennyson, and early in 1829 he
commenced the publication of a small paper
entitled "T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> S<span class="smcapa">NOB</span>, a Literary and Scientific
Journal, <em>not</em> conducted by members of the
University." This was published by W. H. Smith,
of Rose Crescent, Cambridge, and ran for eleven
weeks: its contents were humorous sketches
in prose and verse, and the most remarkable
paper amongst them is the following droll poem
on <em>Timbuctoo</em>, which appeared on the 30th April,
1829, and has most unaccountably been omitted
from recent editions of Thackeray's works:&mdash;</p>

refuse this tiny "Poem of a Gownsman," which was unluckily
not finished on the day appointed for delivery of the several
copies of verses on Timbuctoo. I thought, Sir, it would be
a pity that such a poem should be lost to the world; and
conceiving "T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> S<span class="smcapa">NOB</span>" to be the most widely circulated
periodical in Europe, I have taken the liberty of submitting

gunpowder is notoriously bad, the author thought "Pop"
the better word.</p>

<p>Lines 15-18.&mdash;A concise but affecting description is
here given of the domestic habits of the people. The infamous

expressed in lines 25 and 26.</p></blockquote>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Athough'">Although</ins> this poem is not actually a parody
of Tennyson's <em>Timbuctoo</em>, it is a clever burlesque
of Prize poems in general, and derives interest
as being one of Thackeray's earliest writings.</p>

Tennyson published in 1830, contained <em>Mariana</em>,

so well known that the following parodies

<p class="center">From <em>Fun</em>, February 26th, 1873.</p>

<p>"Oriana," a romantic legend in three acts, by James
Albery, music by F. Clay, was first performed at the Globe
Theatre, on Saturday, February 15th, 1873. The lessee and
manager, Mr. H. J. Montague, performed the part of King
Raymond, that of Oriana being represented by Miss Rose
Massey. The plot was founded on a fairy tale, slightly resembling
Mr. Gilbert's "Palace of Truth," but, beyond the
name, the play had nothing in common with Tennyson's
poem of "Oriana."</p>

<p>In 1832 Tennyson published another small
volume of poems which contained that beautifully
classical piece of blank verse <em>Œnone;</em>
<em>The Sisters</em>, <em>The Palace of Art</em>, <em>Lady Clara Vere
de Vere</em>, <em>The May Queen</em>, <em>The Lotus-Eaters</em>, <em>The
Dream of Fair Women</em>, and <em>Margaret</em>, all of which
have been so frequently parodied that selection
is indeed difficult.</p>

<p>The following parody of Tennyson's, <em>The
Sisters</em>, was <em>apropos</em> to a division in the House
of Commons, relative to the vexed question of
marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and
appeared in <em>The Tomahawk</em>.</p>

number of Ballads and Parodies, and amongst others two

<hr class="r5" />

<p>It is in the strongly marked individuality of
some of Tennyson's early poems that we find,
at once, the secret of much of his popularity,
and the excuse for the vast number of parodies
of his works scattered about in nearly all our
humorous literature; and three of the early
poems have been especially chosen by parodists
as models for imitation; these are the "May
Queen," "Locksley Hall," and the "Charge of
the Light Brigade."</p>

<p>In the "Bon Gaultier Ballads" by Theodore
Martin and Professor Aytoun, will be found
several parodies of Tennyson, also of Lord
Macaulay, Tom Moore, Bulwer Lytton, Mrs.
Browning, and of Leigh Hunt, of whom parodies
are rare.</p>

<p>Of the parodies of Tennyson, "Caroline" and
"The Laureate" have already been quoted; the
others are "The Lay of the Lovelorn" and
"The Dirge of the Drinker," both in imitation
of "Locksley Hall," "La Mort D'Arthur," concerning
Mechi's steel; and the "The Biter Bit."</p>

<p>"The Biter Bit" is a kind of burlesque continuation
of the "May Queen," the tender
pathos of the original being turned into cynical
indifference, whilst preserving a great similarity
of style and versification.</p>

<p>The longest and most important work (by
many also considered the finest) of Alfred
Tennyson is the collection of Arthurian Idyls,
known as the <em>Idyls of the King</em>. These were
originally published in detached parts, in somewhat
irregular order, but in recent editions
the Author has striven to arrange them in
a consecutive and more connected form.</p>

<p>The first to appear in order of date was the
<em>Morte d'Arthur</em>, which was published in the
1842 volume, in the later arrangement of the
poems this has been absorbed into the last Idyl,
entitled "<em>The Passing of Arthur</em>."</p>

  <div class="i0">Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord,</div>
  <div class="i0">King Arthur; then because his wound was deep,</div>
  <div class="i0">The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,</div>

<p>Thus much of the original must indeed be in one's thoughts
ere the <em>Voyage de Guillaume</em> can be appreciated; it recounts
the holiday trip of the Prime Minister to the north in September,
1883. It will be remembered that Mr. Gladstone
was the guest of Sir Donald Currie, on board the <em>Pembroke
Castle</em>, and that Alfred Tennyson was also one of the party.</p>

<p>In the same 1842 volume, appeared "Godiva,"
"Locksley Hall," "Break, Break, Break," and
"The Eagle," of each of which there are some
excellent parodies.&mdash;The old legend of Lady
Godiva, so beautifully retold in blank verse by the
Laureate, has recently been sadly vulgarised
by the processions at Coventry, and the following
poem describes, not unfairly, the scene in
which a somewhat prominent actress stooped

  <div class="i0">Hair-pinned on locks to show'r down to her knee,</div>
  <div class="i0">Donned the rose "fleshings" that she was to wear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then throwing on a shawl she waited there</div>

  <div class="i0">And up the stairs a voice, "The 'oss is come!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And tripping to the door she found a steed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Milk-white and bony, meek, and pink of eye,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a chair and Mr. Sanger's help</div>
  <div class="i0">Clomb on his back, and then one bang'd a door</div>
  <div class="i0">And shouted, "Right!" and so the charger past.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Thus rode she forth, clothed on with scantiness,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the pageant duly took her place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Along with camels and with elephants</div>
  <div class="i0">And men-in-armour, weakest at the knee,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Foresters with horns that wouldn't blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">And clumsy bows, and Odd-fellows as well,</div>
  <div class="i0">In fool regalia; and the Volunteers,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Fire Brigade, and several brazen bands.</div>
  <div class="i0">But chiefly 'twas on her all eyes were fix'd,</div>

  <div class="i0">For making of herself a show; and men</div>
  <div class="i0">Opined that cotton wool she'd freely used;</div>
  <div class="i0">And one low churl, compact of thankless earth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Drawing a pin and rushing at her horse</div>
  <div class="i0">Prick'd&mdash;but it was no good, the steed jogged on</div>
  <div class="i0">As theretofore: and thanks to frequent bangs</div>
  <div class="i0">And shouts of "Right" did reach the end at last</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the day's progress, much to its delight.</div>
  <div class="i0">And she was glad, and hastening to her room</div>
  <div class="i0">She slipp'd her garments on, and issuing claim'd</div>
  <div class="i0">Her fee, and took the earliest train to town,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the ballet, in the foremost row,</div>
  <div class="i0">Danced with her fellows, winning great renown,</div>

<p>In 1855, Messrs. G. Routledge &amp; Co., published
a small volume, by Frank E. Smedley and
Edmund Hodgson Yates, entitled <em>Mirth and
Metre</em>, which contained several excellent parodies,
one entitled Boreäna, after the <em>The Ballad
of Oriana;</em> and another, called Vauxhall, which
imitated <em>Locksley Hall</em>. Most of the parodies in
the book were written by Mr. Edmund H. Yates,
but he gave the credit of Boreäna to Mr. Frank
Smedley, the author of several well-known
novels, who died in May, 1864.</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The dadoed walls, in green were stained, no tint</div>

  <div class="i1">With indigo and lake.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Nor grainèd panel nor enamelled slate</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Two lovely griffins, made of burnished brass,</div>
  <div class="i1">I found, to guard the fireplace on each side.</div>
  <div class="i0">With curling tails (though one was lost, alas!),</div>
  <div class="i1">And mouths that gapèd wide.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">All round the rooms were shelves of black-dyed deal,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">One deep recess, serge-covered, like a lawn,</div>
  <div class="i1">Held, on a brass-nailed shelf, its seat of state,</div>
  <div class="i0">Apart from other pots and pans withdrawn,</div>
  <div class="i1">An ancient kitchen-plate.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Hence whilst the world runs round and round," I said,</div>
  <div class="i1">"I will send forth my wits to gather wool;</div>
  <div class="i0">With task or toil I will not vex my head;</div>
  <div class="i1">But on that plate feed full."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">So day and night upon that plate I gazed,</div>
  <div class="i1">And strove to fix thereon what thought I had;</div>
  <div class="i0">Until my sight grew dim, and my sense dazed,</div>
  <div class="i1">And my digestion bad.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">My brain shrank like a nut adust and dried;</div>
  <div class="i1">I felt that I was not at all myself,</div>

  <div class="i1">That plate upon that shelf.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">That ancient plate of willow-pattern blue,</div>

<p>Those who have read <em>Locksley Hall</em> will greatly
appreciate <em>The Lay of the Lovelorn</em>, a parody
contained in the Bon Gaultier Ballads of Theodore
Martin and Professor Aytoun.</p>

<p>Tennyson's original poem commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Comrades leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn;</div>
  <div class="i0">Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Tis the place, and all around it, as of old the curlews' call,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime</div>
  <div class="i0">With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time.</div>
  <div class="i2">* <span class="mleft3">*</span> <span class="mleft3">*</span> <span class="mleft3">*</span> <span class="mleft3">*</span> <span class="mleft3">*</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with might;</div>
  <div class="i0">Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,</div>
  <div class="i0">And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">O my cousin, shallow hearted! O my Amy, mine no more,</div>
  <div class="i0">O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,</div>
  <div class="i0">Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Is it well to wish thee happy? having known me&mdash;to decline</div>
  <div class="i0">On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Yet it shall be: thou shall lower to his level day by day,</div>
  <div class="i0">What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,</div>
  <div class="i0">Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.</div>
  <div class="i4">* <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!</div>
  <div class="i0">Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest nature's rule.</div>
  <div class="i0">Cursed be the gold that gilds the straightened forehead of the fool.</div>

  <div class="i0">Comrades, you may pass the rosy. With permission of the chair</div>

  <div class="i0">As the husband is, the wife is,&mdash;he is stomach-plagued and old;</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">When his feeble love is sated, he will hold thee surely then</div>
  <div class="i0">Something lower than his hookah,&mdash;something less than his cayenne.</div>

  <div class="i0">What is this? His eyes are pinky. Was't the claret? Oh, no, no,&mdash;</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But that song so wildly plaintive, palls upon my British ears.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twill not do to pine for ever,&mdash;I am getting up in years.</div>

  <div class="i0">Can't I turn the honest penny, scribbling for the weekly press,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in writing Sunday libels drown my private wretchedness?</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Oh, to feel the wild pulsation that in manhood's dawn I knew</div>
  <div class="i0">When my days were all before me, and my years were twenty-two!</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">When I smoked my independent pipe along the Quadrant wide</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">When I went the pace so wildly, caring little what might come;</div>
  <div class="i0">Coffee-milling care and sorrow, with a nose-adapted thumb;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Felt the exquisite enjoyment, tossing nightly off, oh heavens!</div>
  <div class="i0">Brandy at the Cider Cellars, kidneys smoking hot at Evans'!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Or in the Adelphi sitting, half in rapture, half in tears,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Saw Jack Sheppard, noble strippling, act his wondrous feats again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Snapping Newgate's bars of iron, like an infant's daisy chain.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Might was right, and all the terrors, which had held the world in awe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were despised, and prigging prospered, spite of Laurie, spite of law.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">In such scenes as these I triumphed, ere my passion's edge was rusted,</div>

  <div class="i0">Hark! my merry comrade's call me, bawling for another jorum;</div>
  <div class="i0">They would mock me in derision, should I thus appear before 'em.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I'll to Afric, lion-haunted, where the giant forest yields</div>
  <div class="i0">Rarer robes and finer tissues than are sold at Spitalfields.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Or to burst all chains of habit, flinging habit's self aside,</div>
  <div class="i0">I shall walk the tangled jungle in mankind's primeval pride;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Feeding on the luscious berries and the rich cassava root,</div>

  <div class="i0">There, methinks, would be enjoyment, where no envious rule prevents;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sink the steamboats! cuss the railways! rot, O rot the Three per Cents!</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">There the passions, cramped no longer, shall have space to breathe, my cousin!</div>

<p>The following imitation of "Break, Break,
Break," is from <em>Snatches of Song</em>, by F. B. Doveton,
1880, which volume also contains (page 127) a
long, but not very amusing, parody of <em>The
Grandmother</em>, entitled <em>Hard Times</em>.</p>

<p>O<span class="smcapa">UR</span> M<span class="smcapa">ISCELLANY</span> (<em>which ought to have come out,
but didn't</em>), edited by Edmund H. Yates and
R. B. Brough, published by G. Routledge &amp; Co.,
in 1857, contains a number of parodies, amongst
them of Lord Macaulay, E. A. Poe, Longfellow,
and Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Of Tennyson there are two imitations of
<em>Maud;</em> one, nine verses in length, of <em>In <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Memmoriam'">Memoriam</ins></em>,
and one entitled <em>A Character</em>, which is
a rather close parody of a poem having the same
title, published in Tennyson's 1830 volume.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that at the time <em>Our
Miscellany</em> appeared, M. Jullien's Promenade
Concerts were in the full tide of their prosperity,
and that the little fopperies and vanities of the
clever <em>Chef d'orchestre</em>, and his importation of
French military bands were then the talk of the
town.</p>

<p>In 1856 a little sixpenny pamphlet was published
by J. Booth, of Regent Street, entitled
<em>Anti-Maud</em>, by a Poet of the People. Tennyson
had been accused of fanning the warlike spirit
then rampant in the land, and his <em>Maud</em> contained&mdash;in
exquisite poetry&mdash;many of the stock arguments
in favour of war and glory. The "Poet
of the People," in his <em>Anti-Maud</em>, adopted the
other, and less popular view. Read in the light
of subsequent events, this scarce little pamphlet
seems more correct in its deductions, than the
Laureate's war cry in <em>Maud</em>. The author asserts
that <em>Anti-Maud</em> is not merely a <em>jeu d'esprit</em>, but
something of a more earnest character, and he
disclaims any intention of depreciating the
Laureate's poetry. I can quote a few only of
the best of the fifty odd stanzas it contains:</p>

<p>I have quoted so much of this parody because
it was one of the first to draw attention to the
Laureate's love for the pride, pomp and circumstance
of glorious war, a bellicose spirit which
breathes quite as fiercely in his later writings,
as in his early songs. In all cases, where
he has attempted any Patriotic poem, the main
idea seems to be a bloodthirsty hatred of some
other nation; at one time, and for some years, it
was France, next it was Russia, and latterly
some of his writings have been well calculated
to revive our long forgotten animosity to Spain.
In so doing Tennyson has narrowed the circle
of his admirers, for war is far from being the
popular game it once was; and the poet, who
would be loved of all, should avoid controversial
topics. The Laureate's patriotic muse has certainly
sung a few noble songs, but many which
have been deservedly ridiculed; in his official
capacity he has written some of the most exquisite
lines in which adulation of Royalty has ever
been expressed; for whilst we know that his
laurelled predecessors credited the Stuarts and
the Georges with precisely the same virtues
which he has ascribed to members of the present
Royal Family, their <em>official</em> poems were
laughed at at the time, and are now forgotten;
whilst his have been greatly admired, especially
in high quarters, and the coronet which is to
reward his poetical loyalty confers on him, and
the latest of his descendants, a perpetual title
to rule over the people of Great Britain.</p>

<p>All honour to the Poet, <em>as Poet</em>, as a titled
Legislator the choice rather reminds one of the
saying of Beaumarchais' hero;&mdash;"It fallait un
calculateur, ce fut un danseur qui l'obtint," a
saying which I may perhaps be allowed to
parody thus:&mdash;"Il fallait un Legislateur, ce fut
un chanteur qui l'obtint"</p>

<p>For the curious in such matters I give the
following extract from the <cite>St. James's Gazette</cite>
relating to Mr. Tennyson's lineage:&mdash;That Mr.
Tennyson comes of an ancient house is generally
known; not every one perhaps is aware of the
number of princes, soldiers, and statesmen,
famous in British or European history, from
whom he can claim descent. Without pretending
to give an exhaustive list of his royal and
noble ancestors, it may be interesting at the present
moment to point out a few of the more
renowned among them. The Laureate's descent
from John Savage, Earl Rivers (from which stock
came Johnson's friend), implies descent from the
Lady Anne, eldest sister of Edward IV., and so
from sixteen English kings&mdash;namely, the first
three Edwards, Henry III., John, the first two
Henrys, William the Conqueror, Edmund Iron-side,
Ethelred the Unready, Edgar the Peaceable,
Edmund I., Edward the Elder, Alfred, Ethelwulf,
and Egbert. But Edward III. was the son
of Isabella, daughter of Philip the Fair, King of
France, who descended from Hugh Capet, and
nine intervening French Kings, among whom
were Robert II., Philip Augustus, Louis VIII.,
and St. Louis. The last is not the only saint
who figures in this splendid pedigree. The
mother of Edward II. was Eleanor, daughter of
Ferdinand III., King of Castle and Leon, who
was canonized by Clement X. Again, through
the marriage of Edmund of Langley, Duke of
York, with Isabel, daughter of Peter the Cruel,
Mr. Tennyson descends from Sancho the Great
and Alphonso the Wise. Other crowned ancestors
of the poet are the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
and several Kings of Scotland, notably
Malcolm III. and the "gracious Duncan," his
father. In truth, the Shakespearean gallery is
crowded with portraits of his progenitors&mdash;e.g.,
besides those already mentioned, John of Gaunt,
Edmund Mortimer Earl of March, Richard Earl
of Cambridge, Richard Plantagenet "the Yeoman,"
Edmund Beaufort Duke of Somerset,
Lord Hastings (of the reigns of Edward IV. and
Richard III.), and Lord Stanley. Mr. Tennyson is
not only descended from the first Earl of Derby
and that third earl with whose death, according
to Camden, "the glory of hospitality seemed to
fall asleep," but from the "stout Stanley" who
fronted the right of the Scots at Flodden, and
whose name in Scott's poem was the last on the
lips of the dying Marmion. "Lord Marmion,"
says Scott, "is entirely a fictitious personage:"
"but" he adds "that the family of Marmion, Lords
of Fontenay in Normandy, was highly distinguished;
Robert de Marmion, a follower of Duke
William, having obtained a grant of the castle
and town of Tamworth. This Robert's descendant,
Avice, married John, Lord Grey of Rotherfield,
one of the original Knights of the Garter,
whose great-granddaughter became (in 1401)
the wife of John, Lord D'Eyncourt, another
ancestor of Mr. Tennyson's; whose uncle, the
Right Honourable Charles Tennyson, many
years Liberal member for Lambeth, assumed the
name of D'Eyncourt by royal licence."</p>

<p>Probably the learned compiler of this abstruse
genealogy has no time to study the poets, or he
might have read of one who claimed an even
more ancient descent:&mdash;</p>

<p>I now come to a clever and most amusing
little work entitled <cite>Puck on Pegasus</cite>, by H. Cholmondeley-Pennell,
which was published about
sixteen years ago by the late Mr. John Camden
Hotten. In the original edition this work was
a small quarto, with numerous illustrations and
a characteristic frontispiece designed and etched
by dear old George Cruikshank. It has since run
through numerous editions, and is now included
in the series known as <cite>The Mayfair Library</cite>,
published by Chatto and Windus. It contains
the following parodies:&mdash;"Song of In-the-Water,"
after <cite>Longfellow;</cite> "The Du Chaillu
Controversy," after <cite>The Bon Gaultier Ballads;</cite>
"The Fight for the Championship," after <cite>Lord
Macaulay;</cite> "How the Daughters come down at
Dunoon," after <cite>Robert Southey;</cite> "Wus, ever wus,"
after <em>Tom Moore;</em> "Exexolor!" after <cite>Longfellow's</cite>
Excelsior; "Charge of the Light (Irish) Brigade,"
after <cite>Tennyson</cite>.</p>

<p>The incidents referred to in the last-mentioned
parody have now somewhat faded from the
public memory. It is sufficient to say that the
warlike behaviour of the one brigade was quite
as great a contrast to the action of the other, as
the parody here given presents to the original
poem:&mdash;</p>

<p>Like the accomplished authors of <cite>The Bon
Gaultier Ballads</cite>, Mr. Cholmondeley-Pennell is
almost too much a Poet to be thoroughly successful
as a mere Parodist. His muse often carries
him away, and what begins in mere <em>badinage</em>,
and playful imitation, runs into graceful sentiment
and poetical imagery, until the author
pulls her up short, and compels her to turn aside
again into the well-worn "footprints in the sand
of time."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a better example
both of the merits, and, so far as <em>mere parody</em> is
concerned, of the defects of Mr. Cholmondeley-Pennell's
style than in the following lines, which
he has kindly permitted me to insert in this
collection.&mdash;They parody the <cite>Morte D'Arthur:</cite>&mdash;</p>

<p>Since the year 1845 Alfred Tennyson has been
in the receipt of a civil list pension of £200 a
year, so that, in round figures, he has received
about £8,000 of the public money, besides
drawing the annual salary of £100 since his
appointment as Poet Laureate, November, 1850.
The sale of his works has also, of course, been
greatly increased, owing to his official title, and
the present fortunate holder of the laurels enjoys
a fortune much in excess of that of any of
his predecessors in office. From the days of Ben
Jonson downwards Poets Laureate have been
paid to sing the praises of the Royal Family; of
these Laureates, Jonson, Dryden, Southey, and
Wordsworth were true poets, but the others in
the line of succession were mere rhymesters,
whose very names are now all but forgotten.
Eusden, Cibber, and Pye were unremitting in
their production of New Year, and Birth-day
Odes, Southey did little in this way, and
Wordsworth would not stoop to compose any
official poems whatever, although he wore the
laurels for seven years.</p>

<p>It was reserved for Alfred Tennyson to revive
the custom, and he has composed numerous
adulatory poems on events in the domestic
history of our Royal Family.</p>

<p>The smallest praise that can be bestowed on
Tennyson's official poems is that they are immeasurably
superior to any produced by former
Laureates; and although the events recorded
have but a passing interest, the poems will
probably long retain their popularity. The
death of the princess Charlotte in 1817 was, no
doubt, considered at the time as a greater
public loss than was the death of Prince Albert
in 1861; yet who now reads Southey's poem in
her praise? Whereas the beauty of Tennyson's
<em>Dedication</em> of the Idyls of the King will cause it
to be remembered long after people have forgotten
the Prince to whom it was inscribed.</p>

<p>The Dedication commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"T<span class="smcapa">HESE</span> to his Memory&mdash;since he held them dear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Perhaps as finding there unconsciously</div>
  <div class="i0">Some image of himself&mdash;I dedicate,</div>
  <div class="i0">I dedicate,&mdash;I consecrate with tears&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">These Idyls.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"And, indeed, He seems to me</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce other than my own ideal knight."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">OTE.</span>&mdash;Poets Laureate, with the dates of their appointment:&mdash;Benjamin
Jonson, 1615-16; Sir William Davenant,
1638; John Dryden, 1670; Thomas Shadwell, 1688;
Nahum Tate, 1692; Nicholas Rowe, 1715; Lawrence
Eusden, 1718; Colley Cibber, 1730; William Whitehead,
1757; Thomas Warton, 1785; Henry James Pye, 1790;
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Robort'">Robert</ins> Southey, 1813; William Wordsworth, 1843; and
Alfred Tennyson, 19th November, 1850.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continuing in this strain for another fifty
lines, the Poet credits the Prince with every
conceivable virtue, after which, as a contrast, it
is almost a relief to turn to some parody, less
ideal, and less heroic.</p>

  <div class="i15"><em>The Coming K&mdash;&mdash;</em></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>The Coming K&mdash;&mdash;</em> was published about ten
years ago as one of Beeton's Christmas Annuals,
and created a sensation at the time, as it dealt
with some social scandals then fresh in the
public mind. After enjoying a rapid sale for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
short period, it was suddenly withdrawn in a
mysterious manner from circulation, and is now
rather scarce. Following the Dedication, just
quoted, are parodies of the Idyls of the King,
with the following titles:&mdash;The Coming of
Guelpho; Heraint and Shenid; Vilien; Loosealot
and Delaine; The Glass of Ale; Silleas and
Gettarre; The Last Carnival; and Goanveer.
In each of these parts there are parodies well
worthy of preservation, but space will only
permit of the insertion of the following extracts,
one from <cite>Vilien</cite>, the other from <cite>Goanveer</cite>.</p>

<p>In <em>Vilien</em>, the then prevalent crazes for
Spiritualism, Table Rapping, and Cabinet
séances are amusingly satirised; Vilien seeks
out Herlin the Wizard, and thus begs him to
reveal the one great secret of his art:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">Yet if you'd really know what boon I ask,</div>

<p>This mare the Coming K&mdash;&mdash; had backed
heavily, but his trusted friend, Sir Loosealot,
obtaining access to her stable the night before
the race, had drugged her, so that on the day
she hobbled sickly to the winning-post. By this
evil trick Sir Loosealot wins much, whilst the
Coming K&mdash;&mdash; is a heavy loser. Guelpho visits
the mare in her stable, and thus addresses her,
in a parody of the celebrated passage in
Guinevere, where Arthur parts from his faithless
Queen:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that Tennyson's more
recent official poetry has added little to his
fame, whilst it has often been mercilessly ridiculed,
and, of late, his adulatory poems, and
protestations of loyalty, have frequently been
ascribed to interested motives. As soon as it
was definitely announced that he was to be
<em>ennobled</em>, a genealogy was compiled tracing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
descent from the kings who ruled in Britain
long before the Conquest. This grand claim
(which was quoted at page 28) has since been
rather spoilt by the plain statement that Alfred
Tennyson's grandfather was a country attorney,
practising in a small, quiet way in Market
Rasen, North Lincolnshire, who, having made
money in his business, retired, and bought some
land in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But for the title just conferred upon him,
Tennyson's birth and lineage would have been
matters of perfect indifference to his readers.
As for raising Tennyson to the peerage, no
writer seems seriously to have defended an act
which most people look upon as a mistake.
Not one parody in its favour has been written,
but many against it.</p>

<p>Of Tennyson's Patriotic Poems <em>The Charge of
the Light Brigade</em> has always been the most
popular, and has, consequently, been the most
frequently parodied. An excellent parody, taken
from <cite>Puck on Pegasus</cite>, was given on page 31;
the following are the most interesting examples
which remain to be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Thursday, August 3, 1865, an excursion
was made by the Members of the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers of England, to the Dublin
Corporation Waterworks at the Stillorgan and
Roundwood Reservoirs. The members proceeded
from Bray through the Glen of the
Downs, along a portion of the line of pipes, and
at the Roundwood Reservoir they were handsomely
entertained by Sir John Gray, M.P., the
Chairman of the Waterworks Committee, and
by Mr. John Jameson, the Deputy-Chairman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The following parody appeared in a Dublin
newspaper a few days later. Dr. Waller, who is
mentioned in it, was then the Chairman of the
Connoree Copper and Sulphur Mines, in the
Vale of Avoca, which were also visited by the
party of Engineers:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following clever parody was given to me,
about ten years ago, by a young Scotch friend,
who has since gone to New Zealand. I have
no clue to the <em>year</em> in which it was written (the
day of the month, however, was carefully preserved),
nor do I know by <em>whom</em> it was written,
nor where it made its first appearance in public.
Will any kind correspondent furnish me with
information on these points?</p>

<p>The extraordinary run of <em>Our Boys</em>, which
closed in April, 1879, will long excite the
curiosity and wonder of the theatrical world.
Mr. Byron's comedy was produced January 16,
1875, and was played continuously for four years
three months and three days. This would allow
about 1,321 nights, but extra day representations
have raised the total number of performances to
1,362. Besides this return the "long runs" of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
previous days were completely dwarfed. When
<em>Our American Cousin</em> was brought out at the
Haymarket it ran for 496 nights, and the <em>Colleen
Bawn</em> went 278; <em>Meg's Diversion</em>, 330; and
<em>School</em> 381 nights respectively.</p>

<p>"<em>Apropos</em> of the vote for six millions," said <em>The Globe</em>,
"Mr. Gladstone, in his speech, protested against many
of the attacks which had been levelled at him during the
debate, and he threatened Mr. Chaplin in particular with
his vengeance upon some future occasion, and he quoted,

<p>On the 15th March, 1882, at one of the
London Ballad Concerts, Mr. Santley sang, for
the first time, a patriotic song, written by
Alfred Tennyson, the music composed by Mr.
C. V. Stanford. This song was announced with
much ceremony as a new work, whereas it was
simply an abbreviated, and somewhat modified,
arrangement of a poem in five verses, entitled
<em>Hands all Round</em>, which had appeared in the
<em>Examiner</em> in 1852, over the signature <em>Merlin</em>.
The song did not arouse any enthusiasm, and is
now only memorable for the offence its chorus
gave to the temperance party. The first verse
is quoted to illustrate the parodies:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i1">Who loves his native country best!</div>

  <div class="i1">To the great cause of Freedom, drink my friends,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the great name of England round and round."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On this poem getting into the papers, the
Good Templars attached far too much importance
to it, and wrote to remonstrate with the
Poet Laureate. The following reply was sent
to Mr. Malins, the Chief Templar:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"86, Eaton-square, London,&mdash;Sir,&mdash;My father begs to
thank the Committee of the Executive of the Grand Lodge
of England Good Templars for their resolution. No one
honours more highly the good work done by them than my
father. I must, however, ask you to remember that the
common cup has in all ages been employed as a sacred
symbol of unity, and that my father has only used the word
'drink' in reference to this symbol. I much regret that it
should have been otherwise understood.&mdash;Faithfully yours,<br />
H<span class="smcapa">ALLAM</span> T<span class="smcapa">ENNYSON</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following parody, adverting to this correspondence,
appeared in <em>Punch</em>, April 1, 1882:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[The Manchester Good Templars having expostulated with
the Poet Laureate for countenancing "in his latest so-called
patriotic song, <em>Hands all Round</em>," the heathen and intoxicating
custom of drinking toasts (in anything stronger than
toast and water) it is understood that the conscience-stricken
Bard has prepared the following "revised version" for the
special use of the I. O. G. T's.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Tennyson's blank verse has seldom been more
successfully imitated than in <em>The Very Last Idyll</em>,
written by Shirley Brooks for "Punch's Pocket
Book," it concludes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">"And the blameless king,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rising again (to Lancelot's discontent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who held all speeches a tremendous bore),</div>
  <div class="i0">Said, "If one duty to be done remains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And 'tis neglected, all the rest is nought</div>
  <div class="i0">But Dead Sea apples and the acts of apes."</div>
  <div class="i1">Smiled Guinevere, and begged him not to preach;</div>
  <div class="i0">She knew that duty, and it should be done:</div>
  <div class="i0">So what of pudding on that festal night</div>
  <div class="i0">Was not consumed by Arthur and his guests,</div>
  <div class="i0">The queen upon the following morning, fried."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a similar strain, but more ponderous in
treatment is <em>Sir Tray: an Arthurian Idyll</em>, which
appeared in Blackwood's Magazine for January,
1873. A few of the opening lines betray the
whole of the jest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The widow'd dame of Hubbard's ancient line</div>
  <div class="i0">Turned to her cupboard, cornered anglewise</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt this wall and that, in quest of aught</div>
  <div class="i0">To satisfy the craving of Sir Tray,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prick-eared companion of her solitude,</div>
  <div class="i0">Red-spotted, dirty white, and bare of rib,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who followed at her high and pattering heels,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prayer in his eye, prayer in his slinking gait,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prayer in his pendulous pulsating tail.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wide on its creaking jaws revolved the door,</div>
  <div class="i0">The cupboard yawned, deep throated, thinly set</div>
  <div class="i0">For teeth, with bottles, ancient cannisters,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plates of various pattern, blue or white;</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep in the void she thrust her hookèd nose</div>
  <div class="i0">Peering near sighted for the wished-for bone,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whiles her short robe of samite, tilted high,</div>
  <div class="i0">The thrifty darnings of her hose revealed;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The pointed feature travelled o'er the delf,</div>
  <div class="i0">Greasing its tip, but bone or bread found none.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherefore Sir Tray abode still dinnerless,</div>
  <div class="i0">Licking his paws beneath the spinning-wheel,</div>
  <div class="i0">And meditating much on savoury meats."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The hypercritical might object that, inasmuch
as the dame greased the tip of her nose whilst
peering into the recesses of her store-chamber,
that some small rest of edibles was there, but
the poem hurries on to its tragical climax, and
carries the reader breathless past such trivial
objections as these.</p>

<p>The dame passes out, and swiftly down the
streets of Camelot, where she seeks, and finds,
the needed bread, and hastens back&mdash;but all too
late, alas! for Sir Tray lay prone upon the
hearth, and neither breathed nor stirred:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Dead?" said the Dame, while louder wailed Elaine;</div>
  <div class="i0">"I see," she said, "thy fasts were all too long,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy commons all too short, which shortened thus</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy days, tho' thou mightst still have cheered mine age</div>
  <div class="i0">Had I but timelier to the city wonned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thither I must again, and that right soon,</div>
  <div class="i0">For now 'tis meet we lap thee in a shroud,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lay thee in the vault by Astolat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where faithful Tray shall by Sir Hubbard lie."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">Up a by-lane the undertaker dwelt;</div>
  <div class="i0">There day by day he plied his merry trade,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all his undertakings undertook:</div>
  <div class="i0">Erst knight of Arthur's Court, <em>Sir Waldgrave</em> hight,</div>
  <div class="i0">A gruesome carle who hid his jests in gloom,</div>
  <div class="i0">And schooled his lid to counterfeit a tear.</div>
  <div class="i0">With cheerful hammer he a coffin tapt,</div>
  <div class="i0">While hollow, hollow, hollow rang the wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, as he sawed and hammered, thus he sang&mdash;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Wood, hammer, nails, ye build a house for him,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nails, hammer, wood, ye build a house for me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Paying the rent, the taxes, and the rates.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I plant a human acorn in the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">And therefrom straightway springs a goodly tree,</div>
  <div class="i0">Budding for me in bread and beer and beef.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">O Life, dost thou bring Death or Death bring thee?</div>
  <div class="i0">Which of the twain is bringer, which the brought?</div>
  <div class="i0">Since men must die that other men may live.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">O Death, for me thou plump'st thine hollow cheeks,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mak'st of thine antic grin a pleasant smile,</div>
  <div class="i0">And prank'st full gaily in thy winding sheet.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Yet am I but the henwife's favourite chick,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pampered but doomed; and, in the sequel sure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Death will the Undertaker overtake."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus to Sir Waldgrade the Dame recounts
her loss:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Sir Tray that with me dwelt,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lies on my lonely hearthstone stark and stiff;</div>
  <div class="i0">Wagless the tail that waved to welcome me."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Waldgrave interposed in sepulchral
tones&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Oft have I noted, when the jest went round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sad 'twas to see the wag forget his tale&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sadder to see the tail forget its wag."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The description of the coffin follows, and,
lastly, after sundry vicissitudes (including a
visit to the hatter's), the dame returned&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Home through the darksome wold, and raised the latch,</div>
  <div class="i0">And marked, full lighted by the ingle-glow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sir Tray, with spoon in hand, and cat on knee,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spattering the mess about the chaps of Puss."</div>

  <div class="i0">Forth from the purple battlements he fared,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sir Eggnogg of the Rampant Lily, named</div>
  <div class="i0">From that embrasure of his argent shield</div>
  <div class="i0">Given by a thousand leagues of heraldry</div>
  <div class="i0">On snuffy parchments drawn,&mdash;so forth he fared,</div>

  <div class="i0">Where grew the juniper with berries black,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sphery mansions of the future gin.</div>
  <div class="i0">But naught of this decoyed his mind, so bent</div>
  <div class="i0">On fair Miasma, Saxon-blooded girl,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who laughed his loving lullabies to scorn,</div>
  <div class="i0">And would have snatched his hero-sword to deck</div>
  <div class="i0">Her haughty brow, or warm her hands withal,</div>
  <div class="i0">So scornful she: and thence Sir Eggnogg cursed</div>
  <div class="i0">Between his teeth, and chewed his iron boots</div>
  <div class="i0">In spleen of love. But ere the morn was high</div>
  <div class="i0">In the robustious heaven, the postern-tower</div>
  <div class="i0">Clang to the harsh, discordant, slivering scream</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the tire-woman, at the window bent</div>
  <div class="i0">To dress her crispèd hair. She saw, ah woe!</div>
  <div class="i0">The fair Miasma, overbalanced, hurled</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er the flamboyant parapet which ridged</div>
  <div class="i0">The muffled coping of the castle's peak,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prone on the ivory pavement of the court,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which caught and cleft her fairest skull, and sent</div>
  <div class="i0">Her rosy brains to fleck the Orient floor.</div>
  <div class="i0">This saw Sir Eggnogg, in his stirrups poised,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saw he and cursed, with many a deep-mouthed oath,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, finding nothing more could reunite</div>
  <div class="i0">The splintered form of fair Miasma, rode</div>
  <div class="i0">On his careering palfrey to the wars,</div>
  <div class="i0">And there found death, another death than hers.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I, who a decade past had lived recluse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Left for awhile the dust of books and town</div>
  <div class="i0">To share the pastimes of a country house;</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus it chanced that I beheld a scene</div>
  <div class="i0">That steep'd my rusted mind in wonderment.</div>
  <div class="i1">The morn was passing fair; no vagrant cloud</div>
  <div class="i0">Obscured the summer sun, as from the porch</div>
  <div class="i0">I sallied forth to saunter at my will</div>
  <div class="i0">Adown the garden path. Anon I came</div>
  <div class="i0">To where a lawn outspread its verdant robe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose decoration filled me with amaze.</div>
  <div class="i0">Lawns many had I seen in days gone by,</div>
  <div class="i0">But never lawn before the like of this;</div>
  <div class="i0">For o'er its grassy plane a strange device</div>
  <div class="i2">Of parallelograms rectangular</div>
  <div class="i0">Was limn'd in lines of most exceeding whiteness:</div>
  <div class="i0">Athwart the centre of this strange device</div>
  <div class="i0">A threaden net was stretch'd a full yard high,</div>
  <div class="i0">And clasp'd in its reticulated arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">As ivy clasps the oak, two sturdy staves</div>
  <div class="i0">Uprear'd on either side. At either end,</div>
  <div class="i0">Holding opposing corners of the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">A youth and damsel did themselves disport</div>
  <div class="i0">In costume airy, mystic, wonderful;</div>
  <div class="i0">The while in dexter hand each held a quaint</div>
  <div class="i0">And spoon-shaped instrument of chequer'd strings&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Modell'd perchance, upon an ancient lute&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherewith they nimbly urged the bounding sphere</div>
  <div class="i0">Across the meshy bar.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i12">No space had I</div>
  <div class="i0">To ponder, ere they spied me and did call</div>
  <div class="i0">A welcome&mdash;"Hast thou come to see us play?"</div>
  <div class="i0">"What is the game?" I ask'd; they answer'd "Love."</div>
  <div class="i0">"A pretty game," quoth I, "for man or maid,</div>
  <div class="i0">But one wherein a third is out of place;</div>
  <div class="i0">Fain would I therefore go." "Nay, nay," they cried;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Prithee remain, and thou shalt stand as umpire."</div>
  <div class="i0">And so I stay'd, and presently besought</div>
  <div class="i0">To know their prospects. Then the maiden said,</div>
  <div class="i0">"I'm fifteen now;" the gallant, he replied,</div>
  <div class="i0">"And thirty, I." Whereon methought at first</div>
  <div class="i0">That he did somewhat overstate his case,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though she seem'd rather underneath the mark.</div>
  <div class="i0">But when they said that she was thirty-two,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, next, that he was forty, I perceived</div>
  <div class="i0">They told of other things than length of years;</div>
  <div class="i0">Since mortals' ages, e'en at census time,</div>
  <div class="i0">Could scarce be subject to such fluctuations.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus did they wage the contest, hither, thither</div>
  <div class="i0">Running and smiting, till triumphantly</div>
  <div class="i0">The damsel shouted, "Deuce!" Alas! mused I,</div>
  <div class="i0">That lips so fair should utter words so base,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet would have held my peace, had not the youth</div>
  <div class="i0">Turn'd unto me&mdash;"How's that; was that a fault?"</div>
  <div class="i0">"A fault!" I answer'd; "aye, and worse than that;</div>
  <div class="i0">Indeed, 'tis nigh a sin." "Go to," he said;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thou makest merry." So the sport went on;</div>
  <div class="i0">And then she cried, "Advantage, and I win!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And then, "'Tis deuce again!" and then, "Advantage</div>
  <div class="i0">To thee!" and then she strove to reach the ball,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fail'd, and in despair exclaim'd, "Oh, dear,</div>
  <div class="i0">I'm beaten!" and fell back upon the sward.</div>
  <div class="i0">"And this," quoth I, "is this your game of love?</div>
  <div class="i0">Well, I have heard men say that oftentimes</div>
  <div class="i0">True love, once smooth, is scattered to the deuce</div>
  <div class="i0">And she that first advantage hath obtain'd,</div>
  <div class="i0">Doth lose at last, and suffer sad reverse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweet maid, when thou art wed, the deuce avoid,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thou shalt ne'er at least deserve a beating."</div>
  <div class="i0">She laugh'd; he frown'd; I turn'd, and went my way.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the care Tennyson has usually
bestowed upon his writings, he has occasionally
of late years, published poems in the magazines,
remarkable for their inferiority&mdash;even as com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>pared
with ordinary magazine poetry&mdash;by no
means a very high standard. Perhaps he never
wrote a weaker set of lines than those printed
in "Good Words" for March, 1868, they were
headed&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone's fondness for Homer is well
known, and he was doubtless one of the first to
read the Laureate's lines in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>,
called "Achilles Over the Trench." This Trojan
hero will now be dearer than ever to the Premier,
for the Laureate's lines show him to be a man
strangely after the "People's William's" own
heart. Thus, it is matter of public notoriety
that Mr. Gladstone thinks thrice before he makes
his mind up to any great matter, and he is
famed for his historic "three courses." How
curious, then, to find that Achilles, too, has what
may be termed a "triologic" bent of mind!
Evidently it was not till he had thought thrice
that he remained sulking in his tent. And when
he came out and fought, we find, from Alfred
Tennyson, that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">He thrice imbued it in the Trojan's blood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then stood he where three stones were rudely piled,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thrice he thought what next his course should be;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice wiped the triple tears that dewed his cheek,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice muttered words I care not to repeat;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then murmuring his mother's name three times,</div>
  <div class="i0">Made up his mind to slaughter three more foes.</div>
  <div class="i0">So thrice again his spear was launched in space,</div>
  <div class="i0">And three miles off, within Troy's triple walls,</div>
  <div class="i0">Three widows, each with children three, were left</div>

<p>The Poet Laureate's cruise with Sir Donald
Currie, in the autumn of 1883, was an event of
some importance, as he was then afforded an
opportunity of reading his poems to a select
audience of Royal personages; it is generally
supposed that it was during that trip also that
the Prime Minister offered him the title, his
acceptance of which has since been the subject
of so much comment and censure. <em>Punch</em>
(September 22, 1883) described the voyage to
the north in the following comical medley of
parodies of the Laureate's poems:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is now somewhat more than fifty years
since a young, and comparatively obscure
writer addressed some presumptious lines to a
lady of noble family, in which he sneered at her
claims of long descent, ridiculed nobility generally,
and concluded by advising her to go out
amongst the poor, to teach the children, and to
feed the beggars.</p>

<p>The tone of the poem was censorious and
offensive; but Lady Clara Vere de Vere, to whom
it was addressed, let it pass unnoticed by, knowing
that "Everything comes to those who know
how to wait," and now this last daughter of a
hundred Earls has written a good-humoured
rejoinder to the first Baron Tennyson, in which
she playfully assumes her age to have remained
what it was fifty years ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a magazine entitled <em>The Train</em>, published
in 1856, there was a poem called <em>The Three
Voices</em>, written by Mr. Lewis Carroll, who has
since become famous for his quaintly humorous
works. This was a parody of the obvious
truisms, the muddled metaphor, and vague
reasonings contained in Tennyson's <em>Two Voices</em>,
and Mr. Carroll has wisely inserted it in his last
collection of poems (<em>Rhyme? and Reason?</em> Macmillan
and Co.), it is somewhat altered from its
original form, and is much heightened in its
effect by the intensely comic, and ably drawn,
illustrations of Mr. Arthur B. Frost.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this clever parody is too long to
quote entire, and an extract gives but a faint
idea of its terribly grotesque sorrows, and its
whimsical burlesque of the Laureate's reasoning
in <em>The Two Voices:</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>But, in truth, Tennyson has never failed so
signally as when he has attempted to be metaphysical,
and although his admirers have written
many essays to explain the profundity of his
ideas, and the beauties of his philosophy, their
explanations seem to require some explaining,
whilst it also seems that general readers fail to
discern the charm in his would-be philosophical
writings.</p>

<p>The <em>Higher Pantheism</em> may be taken as an
instance. It commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Are not these, O Soul, the vision of Him who reigns?</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Is not the vision He? tho' He be not that which he seems?</div>
  <div class="i0">Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?</div>

  <div class="i0">Dark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why;</div>
  <div class="i0">For is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel "I am I!"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are several other couplets which do
not tend to unravel the poet's tangled web of
thought, whereas if we turn to <em>The Heptalogia</em>
(Chatto and Windus, 1880), we find the whole
mystery treated with much greater lucidity of
expression in <em>The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Princess Ida; or, Castle Adamant</em>, by Mr.
W. S. Gilbert, which was produced at the Savoy
Theatre, on January 5th, 1884, though a
humorous adaptation of Tennyson's <em>Princess</em>, is
not strictly a burlesque, and is styled by the author
"A Respectful Operatic Per-version" of the
Laureate's poem. It is altered from an earlier
piece by Mr. Gilbert on the same theme.
Almost the only passage which can be considered
an actual parody of Tennyson's diction is
the speech of the Princess Ida to the Neophytes,

given in full; of the remainder it will be sufficient
to indicate the works in which they occur, as

<p class="center">Some time ago <em>Funny Folks</em> remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Laureate ought to add a verse to his famous lay of
the Six Hundred. It seems that whenever one of the immortal
brigade dies, a couple of recruits, at least, appear and
fill his place. There are already far more living claimants
to the glory of participating in the famous charge than ever
took part in it.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="i1">"When can their glory fade,</div>
  <div class="i1">If from the Light Brigade</div>
  <div class="i2">When <span class="smcapa">ONE</span> is sundered,</div>
  <div class="i1">Two will his place supply,</div>
  <div class="i1">Ready to multiply</div>
  <div class="i2">Still the Six Hundred?"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in a somewhat similar manner parodies
on this famous poem seem to start up on every
hand. One, not yet mentioned, appeared in
<em>Figaro</em>, November 29, 1876.</p>

<p>Another anonymous parody of the same
original, called "The Charge of the Tight
Brigade," though rather smart, is too slangy in
its language to be inserted.</p>

<p>The following has been sent by Mr. James
Dykes Campbell, who states that it was current
in the Oxford colleges about twenty years ago.
The author's name is not known.</p>

appeared in <em>The Scotsman</em> about ten years ago.</p>

<p>A parody on the same original, entitled <em>A
Dream of Great Players</em> (in reference to Lawn
Tennis) appeared, on the 13th February, 1884, in
<em>Pastime</em>, an ably conducted journal, devoted to
out-door games and recreations. Unlike most
of the sporting papers, <em>Pastime</em> has a distinctly
literary tone, and publishes, from time to time,
clever parodies of our modern poets. Two have
appeared on Tennyson's blank verse, the first
(June 29, 1883), entitled <em>A Fragment of the Lost
Tennisiad;</em> the second, which was much longer,
appeared in the number for July 27, 1883, and

<p>After the defeat of Colonel Burnaby, and the
Hon, A. C. Calthorpe, at the last Birmingham
election, the following parody appeared in <em>The
Gridiron</em>, a local satirical paper.</p>

<p>The dashing Colonel's testimony in favour of
Cockle's pills was the cause of many jokes at
his expense in the election squibs. Messrs.
Stone and Lowe were prominent members of
the Birmingham Conservative party.</p>

"Who sent <em>The Spiteful Letter</em> to Alfred

<blockquote>

<p>"If anybody <em>did</em>&mdash;and nobody doubts that it really was

therefore, addressed a circular to everybody who is anybody
in the round of rhyme, putting the direct question&mdash;'Was it
you, you, or you?' Down to the latest moment answers had
been received from George Macdonald, the Poet Close,
Algernon Swinburne, and Walt Whitman."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Poet Laureate has recently contributed a

paid the writer was said to be 1,000 dollars.</p>

<p>Has the Poet no friends about him who can
point out that by the publication of such painfully
weak effusions, the once great reputation of
Tennyson is being surely, if slowly, undermined;
and that the rising generation will be little
encouraged, by such specimens of his genius, to
read his early works. It is well known that the
Poet Laureate is exceedingly vain of his writings,
and does not hesitate to place them on a par
with those of Milton; this is a point we may
leave to posterity to decide, but it seems most
improbable that even the finest works of the
laurelled, pensioned, titled bard of our days, will
ever be considered worthy of a place by the side
of the glorious and imperishable poems of the
stern old puritan.</p>

<p>As parodies of Tennyson's poems are constantly
being produced, a supplementary collection
of them will be published separately at
some future date.</p>

<p>The death of "C. S. C." will be heard of with
regret by all who enjoy the lighter forms of
English poetry, such as are to be found to perfection
in his two little volumes, entitled "Fly
Leaves" and "Verses and Translations," published
by Messrs. G. Bell and Sons.</p>

<p>Mr. Calverley had an extraordinary ear for
rhythm, and could imitate, at will, the measure
and metre of any poet. Taking some comically
trifling topic, he could so write it up as to reproduce
not only the style, but even the very mode
of thought of his original. Thus, in his poem,
"The Cock and the Bull," he has caught far
more of Robert Browning than the mere verbal
eccentricities; "Wanderers" contains the very
best of all parodies of Tennyson's "Brook"
(quoted on page 30); Matthew Arnold is well
imitated in "Thoughts at a Railway Station;"
whilst the "Ode to Tobacco" reads like a continuation
of Longfellow's "Skeleton in Armour."
For <em>refined parody</em>, as distinguished from mere
verbal burlesque, Mr. Calverley was unapproached,
and no collection of humorous English poetry
would be complete, which did not include several
of his best pieces. His humour was ever genial
and pleasant, without a tinge of malice or ill-will,
and even those whom he so deftly parodied
could have taken no offence at his clever banter.
Mr. Calverley was also a considerable scholar,
as his translations testify, and he left at Oxford
(where he studied before going to Cambridge) a
considerable reputation as a wit and conversationalist.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_WADSWORTH_LONGFELLOW" id="HENRY_WADSWORTH_LONGFELLOW"></a>H. W. Longfellow.</h2>


<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born at
Portland, Maine, on February 27, 1807, and
died on the 24th March, 1882, having thus just
completed his 75th year. After graduating at
the age of eighteen at Bowdoin College, he
entered the office of his father to study the law.
Soon afterwards, however, he left America for
Europe, where he travelled for three years
and a half, in order to qualify himself for a
professorship of modern language, which had
been offered to him in the college where he
had received his education. A few years later
he was appointed to a similar position in Harvard
College. In order to become acquainted with
the literature and language of Northern Europe
he again left America and travelled in Scandinavia,
Germany, and Switzerland, entering upon
his new duties in 1836. Mr. Longfellow commenced
his career as an author while yet
he was an undergraduate, and continued to
write almost to the last. A mere list of his
works would occupy considerable space. They
are thoroughly well known wherever our language
is spoken, and have obtained in this country a
popularity second to that of no English writer.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both
conferred degrees upon Mr. Longfellow, and he
was also elected a member of the Russian
Academy of Science and of the Spanish Academy.</p>

<p>The following are the poems which have been
most frequently selected as the models for
Parodies:&mdash;A Psalm of Life; Beware!; Evangeline;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The Song of Hiawatha; The Village Blacksmith;
Excelsior; Curfew; The Bridge; and
several parts of the Saga of King Olaf.</p>

<p>On the 1st March, 1884, a bust of Longfellow
(by Mr. T. Brock, A.R.A.) was unveiled in Poet's
Corner, Westminster Abbey. It is placed
between the graves of Dryden and Cowley, and
bears this inscription:&mdash;</p>


<h3>L<span class="smcapa">ONGFELLOW.</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"This bust was placed among the memorials of the poets
of England by the English admirers of an American poet,
1884."</p></blockquote>

<p>and on the sides are the dates&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Born at Portland, U.S.A., February 27, 1807.</div>
  <div class="i0">Died at Cambridge, U.S.A., March 24, 1882."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. J. Russell Lowell was present at the
ceremony, and gave an address, in which he
stated that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Longfellow's mind always moved straight towards its
object, was always permeated with the emotions, and gave
them the frankest, the sincerest, and, at the same time, the
most simple expression; and never was there a private
character more answerable to public performance than that
of Longfellow. His nature was consecrated ground, into
which no unclean spirit could ever enter."</p></blockquote>

<p>This tribute to his memory, paid by one who
had known him for nearly forty years, sufficiently
explains the reason why, in the parodies of his
works which are now to be given, nothing of a
personal nature will be inserted. Indeed it is
doubtful whether one unkindly worded, or
spiteful burlesque was ever penned about either
Longfellow, or his works. The absence of this
element will be all the more noticeable as following
directly after the parodies of the Poet
Laureate, whose actions and writings have
invited so many attacks. Tennyson's early
sneers at hereditary nobility, as contrasted with
his adulation of royalty, and the exaggerated
praise of princes in his official poems of later
years. His involved, and often obscure, mode of
writing, especially when attempting to deal
with metaphysical topics; his narrow insular
prejudices; his frequent writings in praise of
war, and calling aloud for the blood of either
the French, or the Russians, or the Spaniards.
And, lastly, his acceptance of a coronet which
sits grotesquely enough on the laurels he so
long has worn as Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>In all this there was ample room for adverse
comment, which the life and works of Longfellow
never afforded. The tenderness, the
grace, the sweet pathos, and the exquisite simplicity
of his poems, combined with the purity,
charity, and kindness of his personal character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
were such that detraction, envy, and malice were
dumb, and criticism itself was almost silenced.</p>

<p>Hence the parodies will be found to consist
principally of imitations of his style, language,
or ideas, or of reproductions of his poems in a
grotesque form. In some cases a few verses of
the original are given for the convenience of
comparison with the parodies.</p>

<p>Longfellow's <em>Song of Hiawatha</em> certainly
invites parody, and its easy metre is readily
caught up by any one having an ordinarily
good ear, and knack of versification. Consequently
parodies of it abound; unfortunately
they become somewhat wearisome in perusal
from the monotonous diction, and some of the
best only will be quoted at length.</p>

<p>The following, written by Mr. J. W. Morris,
appeared in the <em>Bath and Cheltenham Gazette</em>
shortly after the appearance of Longfellow's
poem, and is interesting as giving an account
of the feelings with which <em>Hiawatha</em> was first
received:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1856, a small shilling volume of 120 pages
was published by George Routledge and Co.,
as a companion to Longfellow's <em>Hiawatha</em>.
This was entitled, "<em>The Song of Drop o' Wather</em>, a
London legend, by Harry Wandsworth Shortfellow,"
and is now scarce. It commences thus:&mdash;</p>


<h3>A<span class="smcapa">POLOGY FOR THERE BEING NO</span> P<span class="smcapa">REFACE</span>.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">UTHOR</span> (<em>considering</em>). "People expect a preface; and
this is the place for one. But there is no preface in the
great 'Indian Edda' which has occasioned this poem. The
author of that work gives his explanation to the public in
the Notes and Vocabulary; then, of course, mine also,
ought (and is) to be found in the Notes and Vocabulary to
'The Song of Drop o' Wather.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follow the contents, consisting of an
Introduction and thirteen chapters, namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp;I. Drop o' Wather's Childhood.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp; II. Drop o' Wather and Pudgy-Wheezy.</div>
  <div class="i0">&nbsp;III. Drop o' Wather's Fasting.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp;IV. Drop o' Wather's Friends.</div>
  <div class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp; V. Drop o' Wather's Filching.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp;VI. Drop o' Wather's Wooing.</div>
  <div class="i0">&nbsp;VII. Drop o' Wather's Wedding.</div>
  <div class="i0">VIII. The Ghost of the Star and Garter.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp; IX. Bilking the Runners.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp;&nbsp; X. Paw-Paw-Keeneyes.</div>
  <div class="i0"> &nbsp;XI. The Hunting of Paw-Paw-Keeneyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">&nbsp;XII. The Fate of Queershin.</div>
  <div class="i0">XIII. Drop o' Water's Departure.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In its completeness and closeness of imitation,
this anonymous work is the best parody extant
of the <em>Song of Hiawatha</em>. From the introduction,
and the first chapter, it will be gathered that the
hero is a poor little gutter child, who grows up to
be a thief. The following chapters trace his career
in crime, and the last describes his departure to
Australia as a repentant emigrant.</p>

  <div class="i0">Thus was born young Drop o' Wather,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus was born the child of squalor.</div>
  <div class="i0">He was named, by those who knew him,</div>

  <div class="i0">For what's called an Irish reason,</div>

<p>This clever parody is followed by amusing
burlesque notes, the first of which thus explains
the origin of <em>The Song of Drop o' Wather</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This London Legend&mdash;if it may be so called&mdash;has been
suggested by an interesting Indian tradition, given to the
world in the form of a beautiful poem. The picturesque
scenery, vivid description, and glowing imagery to be found
in that production, are fully felt; while their charm is no
more disparaged by the present sportive trifle, than the
sublimity of Shakespeare has been lessened by the burlesques
and parodies that have been made from time to time upon
his great dramas. The tragedy of <em>Hamlet</em> is exalted, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
lowered, by Mr. Poole's admirably clever travestie. The
mere fact of burlesquing a work avouches its excellence&mdash;certainly
its popularity."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the author of
this amusing work should remain unknown.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Mr. H. Cholmondeley-Pennell's <em>Puck on
Pegasus</em> (Chatto and Windus) has gone through
so many editions, and is such a favourite book,
that his imitation of <em>Hiawatha</em> is familiar to
most people. The author has recently somewhat
modified its opening lines. As thus
altered it will shortly appear in a selection of
Mr. H. C. Pennell's poems, and he has kindly
allowed me to include it in this collection.</p>

<p>The original poem in <em>Puck on Pegasus</em> commenced
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Mr. Shirley Brooks composed a
number of clever parodies, many of which were
contributed to <em>Punch</em> during his Editorship of
that journal. Three of the longest and most
amusing of these were <em>The Very Last Idyll</em>, after
Tennyson; <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>,
after Coleridge; and The <em>Song of Hiawatha</em>, after
Longfellow. A quotation from The <em>Very Last
Idyll</em> was given on page 44; and the parody on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Coleridge will be quoted when that author is
reached; the parody of Longfellow, which appeared
in <em>Punch</em> as far back as 1856, commenced
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is possible that Longfellow had the motto
of New York, "<em>Excelsior</em>," in his mind when he
composed this hackneyed poem, which has
served as the model for hundreds of parodies,
and particularly for advertising purposes. A
few of the more amusing only can be inserted.</p>


<h3>E<span class="smcapa">XCELSIOR IN</span> "P<span class="smcapa">IDGIN</span> E<span class="smcapa">NGLISH</span>."</h3>

<p>The following article is from <em>Pro and Con</em>,
December 14, 1872.</p>

<p>"Pidgin English is the name given to an
absurd <em>patois</em> which is used in conversation
between the Chinese celestials, and the outer
barbarians. It appears to be a physical impossibility
for a Chinaman to pronounce the letter
<em>r</em> as in rough, cry, or curry, which he turns into
lough, cly, and cully, as young English children
often do. V, he turns into W, th into f, and to
most words ending with a consonant, he adds a
final syllable, as in <em>find findie</em>, <em>catch catchee</em>, &amp;c.
I, me, my, and mine, are all expressed by one
word, <em>my</em>. The vocabulary consists of a few
words of French origin, such as savey, one or
two from the Portuguese, many common
Chinese expressions, such as <em>chop-chop</em> for quick;
<em>man-man</em>, which means stop; <em>maskee</em>, never mind,
or do not mind; <em>chin-chin</em>, good-bye; <em>welly culio</em>,
or <em>muchee culio</em>, very curious; <em>Foss-pidgin-man</em>, a
priest; and <em>Topside Galah</em>, hurrah for the top, or
Excelsior. There is also a plentiful use of the word
<em>pidgin</em>, which is simply a corruption of our word
<em>business</em>, but it appears to be applied with the
utmost impartiality, to a variety of most incongruous
phrases. As an example of every day
talk, a lady telling her nurse to bring down her
little girl and boy to see a visitor would say,&mdash;'Aymah,
suppose you go topside catchee two
piecee chiloe, bull chiloe, cow chiloe, chop chop.'
From a gentleman well acquainted with China
and the Chinese, we have received the following
clever imitation of Excelsior, which is pronounced
a very fair specimen of Pidgin English":&mdash;</p>

<p>Another long parody of the same original was
contained in <cite>Punch</cite>, September 20, 1879. It was
entitled "A Modern Saga," and consisted of
nine verses, describing Professor Nordenskiöld's
travels and discoveries concerning the North-East
passage.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>It is now a good many years since a well-known
American author, Mr. Bayard Taylor,
produced a clever little book, entitled "Diversions
of the Echo Club." The late Mr. John
Camden Hotten published it in London, and it
has since gone through several editions. The
scheme of the book is thus given by the
author:&mdash;"In the rear of Karl Schäfer's lager-beer
cellar and restaurant&mdash;which everyone
knows, is but a block from the central part of
Broadway&mdash;there is a small room, with a vaulted
ceiling, which Karl calls his <em>Löwengrube</em>, or
Lions' Den. Here, in their Bohemian days,
Zoïlus and the Gannet had been accustomed to
meet, discuss literary projects, and read fragments
of manuscript to each other. The Chorus,
the Ancient and young Galahad gradually fell
into the same habit, and thus a little circle of
six, seven, or eight members came to be formed.
The room could comfortably contain no more:
it was quiet, with a dim, smoky, confidential
atmosphere, and suggested Auerbach's Cellar to
the Ancient, who had been in Leipzig.</p>

<p>Here authors, books, magazines, and newspapers
were talked about; sometimes a manuscript
poem was read by its writer; while mild
potations of beer and the dreamy breath of cigars
delayed the nervous, fidgetty, clattering-footed
American Hours. The character which the
society assumed for a short time was purely
accidental. As one of the Chorus, I was present
at the first meeting, and, of course, I never
failed afterwards. The four authors who furnished
our entertainment were not aware that I
had written down, from memory, the substance
of the conversations, until our evenings came to
an end, and I have had some difficulty in obtaining
their permission to publish my reports."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>These so-called "Reports" describe the proceedings
at eight meetings of the Club, and the
conversation is devoted to criticisms of the most
famous modern poets. The members next proceed
to draw lots as to whose works they shall
imitate, the result being a series of parodies, or,
more correctly speaking, comical imitations of
style, many of which are exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p>The principal poets thus parodied are William
Morris; Robert Browning; E. A. Poe; John
Keats; Mrs. Sigourney; A. C. Swinburne;
R. W. Emerson; E. C. Stedman; Dante G.
Rossetti; Barry Cornwall; J. G. Whittier;
Oliver Wendell Holmes; Alfred Tennyson;
H. W. Longfellow; Walt Whitman; Bret
Harte; J. R. Lowell; Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett
Browning; and several less known authors.</p>

<p>Amongst the minor poets are included several
American writers, whose works are almost
unknown to English readers.</p>

<p>On the Fifth night <em>Zoilus</em> draws <em>Longfellow</em>, and
his comrades caution him to beware how he
treats an author, already a classic, whose works
have been complimented by many ordinary
parodies. He composes the following imitation
of Longfellow's hexameters:&mdash;</p>


<h3>N<span class="smcapa">AUVOO.</span></h3>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">This is the place: be still for a while, my high-pressure steamboat!</div>
  <div class="i0">Let me survey the spot where the Mormons builded their temple.</div>
  <div class="i0">Much have I mused on the wreck and ruin of ancient religions,</div>
  <div class="i0">Scandinavian, Greek, Assyrian, Zend, and the Sanskrit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yea, and explored the mysteries hidden in Talmudic targums,</div>
  <div class="i0">Caught the gleam of Chrysaor's sword and occulted Orion,</div>
  <div class="i0">Backward spelled the lines of the Hebrew graveyard at Newport,</div>
  <div class="i0">Studied Ojibwa symbols and those of the Quarry of Pipestone,</div>
  <div class="i0">Also the myths of the Zulus whose questions converted Colenso,</div>
  <div class="i0">So, methinks, it were well I should muse a little at Nauvoo.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Fair was he not, the primitive Prophet, nor he who succeeded,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hardly for poetry fit, though using the Urim and Thummin.</div>
  <div class="i0">Had he but borrowed Levitical trappings, the girdle and ephod,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fine twined linen, and ouches of gold, and bells and pomegranates,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, indeed, might have kindled the weird necromancy of fancy.</div>
  <div class="i0">Had he but set up mystical forms, like Astarte or Peor,</div>
  <div class="i0">Balder, or Freya, Quetzalcoatl, Perun, Manabozho,</div>
  <div class="i0">Verily, though to the sense theologic it might be offensive,</div>
  <div class="i0">Great were the gain to the pictured, flashing speech of the poet.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Yet the Muse that delights in Mesopotamian numbers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Vague and vast as the roar of the wind in a forest of pine-trees,</div>
  <div class="i0">Now must tune her strings to the names of Joseph and Brigham.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hebrew, the first; and a Smith before the Deluge was Tubal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thor of the East, who first made iron ring to the hammer;</div>
  <div class="i0">So on the iron heads of the people about him, the latter,</div>
  <div class="i0">Striking the sparks of belief and forging their faith in the Good Time</div>
  <div class="i0">Coming, the Latter Day, as he called it,&mdash;the Kingdom of Zion.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, in the words of Philip the Eunuch unto Belshazzar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Came to him multitudes wan, diseased and decrepit of spirit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Came and heard and believed, and builded the temple of Nauvoo.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">All is past; for Joseph was smitten with lead from a pistol,</div>
  <div class="i0">Brigham went with the others over the prairies to Salt Lake.</div>
  <div class="i0">Answers now to the long, disconsolate wail of the steamer,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hoarse, inarticulate, shrill, the rolling and bounding of ten-pins,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Answers the voice of the bar-tender, mixing the smash and the julep,</div>
  <div class="i0">Answers, precocious, the boy, and bites a chew of tobacco.</div>
  <div class="i0">Lone as the towers of Afrasiab now is the seat of the Prophet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mournful, inspiring to verse, though seeming utterly vulgar:</div>
  <div class="i0">Also&mdash;for each thing now is expected to furnish a moral&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Teaching innumerable lessons for who so believes and is patient.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, that readest, be resolute, learn to be strong and to suffer!</div>
  <div class="i0">Let the dead Past bury its dead and act in the Present!</div>
  <div class="i0">Bear a banner of strange devices, "Forever" and "Never!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Build in the walls of time the fame of a permanent Nauvoo,</div>
  <div class="i0">So that thy brethren may see it and say, "Go thou and do likewise!"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This poem does not altogether meet with his
comrades' approval; Zoïlus retorts that "it is
no easy thing to be funny in hexameters; the
Sapphic verse is much more practicable."</p>

<p><em>The Gannet</em> hereupon asserts that he could
write an imitation of Longfellow's higher strains&mdash;not
of those which are so well known and so
much quoted&mdash;which would be fairer to the
poet, and after a short interval produces&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">Then, peering through the pane, as men of sin do,</div>

  <div class="i0">Her gentle foot propelled the tireless treadle,</div>

<p>It may be said of "Diversions of the Echo
Club" (now published by Messrs. Chatto and
Windus), that whilst many of the parodies are
amusing, none are either vulgar or ill-natured;
the criticisms on the various poets are generally
just, thoughtful, and keenly perceptive.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Before leaving Longfellow there are two
amusing imitations of Hiawatha to be quoted;
Unfortunately, the very clever <em>Song of Big Ben</em>
is too long to quote in full, but it is easily
accessible:&mdash;</p>


<h3>THE SONG OF BIG BEN.</h3>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">S<span class="smcapa">HOULD</span> you ask me why these columns</div>
  <div class="i0">Filled with words of many speakers&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Why this record of their doings,</div>
  <div class="i0">With their frequent repetitions,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their inane deliberations,</div>
  <div class="i0">And their aggravating dulness?</div>
  <div class="i2">I should answer, I should tell you,</div>
  <div class="i0">"That I write them as I hear them,</div>
  <div class="i0">As I hear, and as I see them;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That the world may learn what happens</div>
  <div class="i0">In the painted, gilded chamber,</div>
  <div class="i0">In the chapel of St. Stephen's,</div>
  <div class="i0">At the House of Talkee-Talkee,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, upon the woolsack, patient,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lolls the Chancellor, hard-headed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, enthroned above the table,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sadly sits and broods the Speaker."</div>
  <div class="i1">Should you ask me why he sits there?</div>
  <div class="i0">I should answer, I should tell you,</div>
  <div class="i0">"'Tis because the people will it;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis because they send up members</div>
  <div class="i0">Who will talk for moons together;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nought accomplishing, yet spouting,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like the dolphin, Mishe-no-zha,</div>
  <div class="i0">Weak and watery stuff for ever."</div>
  <div class="i1">If still further you should ask me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saying "But what do these members,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the many like unto them,</div>
  <div class="i0">In the House of Talkee-Talkee?"</div>
  <div class="i1">I should answer your enquiry</div>
  <div class="i0">Straightway in such words as follow:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Much they love to hear their voices</div>
  <div class="i0">Talking rubbish at all seasons:</div>
  <div class="i0">Many 'mongst them seize all chances</div>
  <div class="i0">For the riding of their hobbies;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ride them late and ride them early,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ride them through the Standing Orders;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ride them without bit or bridle,</div>
  <div class="i0">Knowing not, nor caring whither."</div>
  <div class="i1">And if once again you query,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saying, "Is this all they do there?"</div>
  <div class="i1">I should answer your fresh query,</div>
  <div class="i0">I should meet your new conundrum</div>
  <div class="i0">Right away in some such fashion</div>
  <div class="i0">As the following, for instance,</div>
  <div class="i0">I should tell you, "There are many</div>
  <div class="i0">Who will bide their time with patience,</div>
  <div class="i0">Knowing that to them by waiting</div>
  <div class="i0">Will come all the things they long for.</div>
  <div class="i0">That M.P. means oft More Power;</div>
  <div class="i0">That 'twill bring them briefs and clients,</div>
  <div class="i0">Make them 'guinea-pigs' and chairmen,</div>
  <div class="i0">Knight them, maybe, in the future;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or ennoble them if only</div>
  <div class="i0">They will spend their money freely</div>
  <div class="i0">For the party they belong to."</div>
  <div class="i1">If you really had the conscience</div>
  <div class="i0">To make any more enquiries,</div>
  <div class="i0">I would answer, I should tell you</div>
  <div class="i0">Not to ask more leading questions,</div>
  <div class="i0">But to wait and read these columns.</div>
  <div class="i0">In these records find your answers,</div>
  <div class="i0">In these lines replies discover.</div>

<p>A <em>jeu d'esprit</em> somewhat in the nature of <em>The
Rejected Addresses</em> has recently been published
by Mr. George Dryden, of Lothian Street, Edinburgh.
It is entitled "<em>Rejected Tercentenary
Songs</em>, with the comments of the Committee
appended." Edited by Rolus Ray.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Edinburgh
University has just been celebrating its Tercentenary,
and the contents of this amusing
little sixpenny pamphlet consist of the Poems
supposed to have been sent in, by matriculated
students of the University, in competition for a
prize of Ten Guineas, offered by the Tercentenary
Committee for the best song in honour
of the occasion.</p>

<p>It contains numerous Latin and Macaronic
verses, a long parody of Walt Whitman, one of
Gilbert, and two of Longfellow, which I venture
to quote. The first is incomplete:&mdash;</p>

 </div>

<p>The author of <em>The Dagonet Ballads</em> has produced
so many pathetic poems, descriptive of
the terrible miseries of our London poor, that
one is rather apt to overlook the humorous
poetry proceeding from the same pen. But, like
all true masters of pathos, this poet of the people
has the power to summon up smiles through
our tears. It was well said of Tom Hood "that
the blending of the grave with the gay which
pervaded his writings, makes it no easy task to
class his poems under the heads of 'serious'
and 'comic.'" This remark applies with equal
force to the poems of George R. Sims, and were
it possible to anticipate the verdict of posterity
we might expect to find the names of Hood
and Sims classed together; indeed, so far as
practical results are concerned, the philanthropical
efforts of the younger poet are likely
far to exceed anything that was achieved by the
author of <em>The Bridge of Sighs</em> and <em>The Song of the
Shirt</em>.</p>

<p>But this is not the place to consider Mr. Sims'
position as a serious writer, although, indeed,
even the following poem has a moral:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">Rose the melodious sounds of the "dogs" which are known as "the jolly,"</div>
  <div class="i0">"Slapping" and "banging" along through that noisy and meaningless ditty.</div>

  <div class="i0">Went forth De Whyskers the bold, brimfull of the valour of Holland,</div>
  <div class="i0">Flashed both his eyes in the dark with a gleam that was quite meteoric,</div>
  <div class="i0">As flashes the pheasant's tail when he hears the first gun in October.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now with a yell and a spring the cads came up to the onset,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cursing and swearing amain, and throwing their arms out like thunder.</div>
  <div class="i0">Stopping before All Saints' the hideous work of Dean Aldrich,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stopping De Whyskers made emphatic the sign for the battle,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thereon he let fall a blow swift like an armourer's hammer,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down on his face fell a cad as falls an oak on the mountains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forth from his nose came "the red" as oft in the vintage the dresser</div>
  <div class="i0">Squeezes the blushing grape on the plains of Estremadura.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now from the end of the High a rush of the cads overwhelming</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweeps as the sea sweeps on in the long dark nights of the winter,</div>
  <div class="i0">Howling as howl the wolves through the snow in the forests of Sweden;</div>
  <div class="i0">Blow after blow is struck, as the flakes come down in the snowstorm.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now from the Turl to the Broad, and St. Giles's, abode of the peaceful,</div>
  <div class="i0">Even to Worcester the slow, or <em>Botany Bay</em>, as they call it,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down by Trinity Gates, and Balliol beloved of the scholar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down by the temple of Tom, whence the Curfew rings in the gloaming</div>
  <div class="i0">Thundered the fray till the rain came down on the scene as a damper.</div>

<p>The great "Town and Gown" rows that used
to occur annually on the Fifth of November,
between the undergraduates and the townspeople,
have been gradually dying out, but the
memory of them still lingers in many old College
Rhymes and traditions. They are most vividly
described in <em>Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman</em>,
a light-hearted clever little work, by the Rev. E.
Bradley, Rector of Lenton, better known under
his pseudonym of Cuthbert Bede. Mr. Bradley,
although himself a Cambridge man, was intimately
acquainted with Oxford.</p>

  <div class="i0">Mass-book and rosary too, with a bunch of keys at her girdle,</div>
  <div class="i0">Walk'd, with a pensive air, Beatrice the Carmelite sister.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fair of aspect was she, but a trifle vivacious and worldly,</div>
  <div class="i0">And not altogether cut out for a life of devout contemplation.</div>
  <div class="i0">More of freedom already had she than the rest of the sisters,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For hers was the duty to ope the gates of the convent, and take in</div>
  <div class="i0">Messages, parcels, <em>et cetera</em>, from those who came to the wicket.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ever and often she paused to gaze on the face of Our Lady,</div>
  <div class="i0">Limn'd in a picture above by some old pre-Raphaelite Master;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then would she say to herself (because there was none else to talk to),</div>
  <div class="i0">"Why should I thus be immured, when people outside are enjoying</div>
  <div class="i0">Thousands of sights and scenes, while I'm not allowed to behold them,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thousands of joys and of changes, while I am joyless and changeless?</div>
  <div class="i0">No, I can bear it no longer. I'll hasten away from the Convent:</div>
  <div class="i0">Now is the time, for all's quiet; there's no one to see or to catch me."</div>
  <div class="i0">So resolving at length, she took off her habit monastic,</div>
  <div class="i0">And promptly array'd herself in smuggled secular garments;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then on the kneeling-desk she laid down the keys, in a safeplace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where some one or other, or somebody else, would certainly find them.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Take thou charge of these keys, blest Mother," then murmured Beatrice,</div>
  <div class="i0">"And guard all the nuns in this holy but insupportable building."</div>
  <div class="i0">And as she spoke these words, the eyes of the picture were fasten'd</div>
  <div class="i0">With mournful expression upon her, and tears could be seen on the canvas;</div>
  <div class="i0">Little she heeded, however, her thoughts had played truant before her,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then stole she out of the portal, and never once looking behind her,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrapp'd in an ample cloak, and further concealed by the darkness,</div>
  <div class="i0">Out through the streets of the city Beatrice quickly skedaddled.</div>

  <div class="i0">Down from her canvas and frame, there stepp'd the blessed Madonna,</div>
  <div class="i0">Took up the keys and the raiment Beatrice had quitted, and wore them,</div>
  <div class="i0">Also assuming the face and figure of her who was absent;</div>
  <div class="i0">Became in appearance a nun, so that none could discover the difference.</div>
  <div class="i0">Save that the sisters agreed that Beatrice the portress was growing</div>
  <div class="i0">Better and better, as one who aspired to canonization;</div>
  <div class="i0">Daily abounding in grace, a pattern to all in the convent;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till it would not have surprised them to see a celestial halo</div>
  <div class="i0">Gather around her head, and pinions spring from her shoulders,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, when too good for this world, she might fly away to a better.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her post was below her deserts, and so by promotion they made her</div>
  <div class="i0">Mistress of all the novices seeking religious instruction.</div>
  <div class="i0">Such was her great success in that tender and beautiful office,</div>

  <div class="i0">Many a day had pass'd since Beatrice escaped from the convent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Much had she seen of the world, and its wickedness greatly distress'd her;</div>
  <div class="i0">Oft she repented her act, and long'd to return, yet she dared not;</div>
  <div class="i0">Oft was determined to go, still she "stood on the order of going."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus it at last occurr'd that her convent's secular agent</div>
  <div class="i0">Entered one day, in the house where the truant sister was staying,</div>
  <div class="i0">But changed as she was in appearance, he did not know her from Adam;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst he in his clerical garb was to her a familiar figure.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Now I shall learn," thought she, "what they say of my flight and my absence."</div>
  <div class="i0">And so she eagerly asked of the nuns and of sister Beatrice,</div>
  <div class="i0">As of a friend she had known when living near to the convent.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Truly," the factor replied, "She is still the pride of our sisters,</div>
  <div class="i0">Favourite too of the abbess, and worthy of all our affection.</div>
  <div class="i0">Would there were more of her kind in <em>some</em> houses monastic I know of,"</div>
  <div class="i0">Puzzled and rather distress'd, then answer'd the truant <em>religieuse</em>,</div>
  <div class="i0">"She whom I speak of, alas! was less of a saint than a sinner,</div>
  <div class="i0">She fled from the veil and the cell, so surely you speak of another?"</div>
  <div class="i0">"Not in the least, my child," the secular agent responded;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Sister Beatrice, the saint-like, did <em>not</em> run away from the cloister,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mistress is she of the novices. Why should she go? Stuff and nonsense!"</div>
  <div class="i0">"What can it mean?" thought Beatrice, "and who is my double and namesake?"</div>
  <div class="i0">So when the agent was gone, resolved she would settle the question,</div>
  <div class="i0">Off to the convent she went, and knocked at the portal familiar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ask'd for the sister Beatrice, was shown to the parlour and found a</div>
  <div class="i0">Counterpart of herself, as she was in her days of seclusion.</div>
  <div class="i0">Down on her knees went Beatrice&mdash;the why and the wherefore she knew not.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Welcome, my daughter, again," said her double, the blessed Madonna;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Now I restore you your keys, your robe, and your other belongings,</div>
  <div class="i0">Adding the excellent name and promotion I've won in your likeness;</div>
  <div class="i0">Be you a nun as before, but more pious; farewell, take my blessing."</div>
  <div class="i0">Speaking, she melted away in the holy pre-Raphaelite picture.</div>
  <div class="i0">Again was Beatrice "herself," like Richard the third, <em>à la</em> Shakespeare,</div>
  <div class="i0">Growing in grace from that day, and winning the glory of Saintship;</div>
  <div class="i0">While each of the pupils she taught, went to heaven as surely as <em>she</em> did.</div>

London, 1882.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARLES_WOLFE" id="CHARLES_WOLFE"></a>Charles Wolfe.</h2>

<p>The Reverend Charles Wolfe, who was born
in Dublin in 1791, has earned literary immortality
by one short poem, and that copied with
considerable closeness from a prose account of
the incident to which it refers. Reading in the
<em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em> a description of the
death and burial of Sir John Moore, the young
poet turned it into verse with such sublime
pathos, such taste and skill, that his poem has
obtained imperishable fame in our literature.</p>

<p>Mr. Wolfe also produced a few other poems
of unquestionable grace and pathos, but nothing
approaching the beauty of his immortal ode.
He was, for a time, curate of Ballyclog, in
Tyrone, and afterwards of Donoughmore. His
arduous duties in a large, wild, and very scattered
parish left him little leisure to cultivate the
muses, and soon told on his delicate constitution.
He died of consumption on 21st February,
1823, at the early age of 32, and thus the assertion
of his detractors that he produced nothing
else of sufficient merit to show that he could
have written the ode in question, may be easily
met by the two pleas&mdash;firstly, that he had other
duties to perform; and, secondly, that his career
was too brief to admit of many, or great, performances.</p>

<p>The battle of Corunna was fought on
January 16, 1809, by the British army, about
15,000 strong, under Sir John Moore, against a
force of about 20,000 Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The British troops had just safely accomplished
a retreat to the coast in the face of a superior
force, and were on the point of embarking,
when the French attacked; the enemy was
repulsed, but the British loss was very great,
and Sir John Moore, who was struck on the left
shoulder by a cannon ball, died, much lamented
by his troops. His body was removed at midnight
to the citadel of Corunna, and a grave was
dug for him on the ramparts by a party of the
9th Regiment. No coffin could be procured,
and the officers of his staff wrapped the body,
dressed as it was, in a military cloak and
blankets. The interment was hastened, for
firing was heard, and the officers feared that if
a serious attack were made, they should be
ordered away, and not allowed to pay him their
last duty. The embarkation of the troops took
place next day, under the command of Sir
David Baird, who had also been wounded in the
fight.</p>

<p>The following is what Lord Byron correctly
termed, "The most perfect Ode in the
language":&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,</div>
  <div class="i1">As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot</div>
  <div class="i1">O'er the grave where our hero we buried.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">We buried him darkly at dead of night,</div>
  <div class="i1">The sods with our bayonets turning.</div>

  <div class="i1">Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Few and short were the prayers we said,</div>
  <div class="i1">And we spoke not a word of sorrow;</div>
  <div class="i0">But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,</div>
  <div class="i1">And we bitterly thought of the morrow.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,</div>
  <div class="i1">And smoothed down his lonely pillow,</div>
  <div class="i0">That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,</div>
  <div class="i1">And we far away on the billow!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,</div>
  <div class="i1">And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on</div>
  <div class="i1">In the grave where a Briton has laid him.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But half of our heavy task was done,</div>
  <div class="i1">When the clock struck the hour for retiring;</div>
  <div class="i0">And we heard the distant and random gun</div>
  <div class="i1">That the foe was sullenly firing.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Slowly and sadly we laid him down,</div>
  <div class="i1">From the field of his fame fresh and gory;</div>
  <div class="i0">We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">But we left him alone with his glory!</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ode was first published in <em>Currick's
Morning Post</em> (Ireland) in 1815, with the signature
"W. C.," and the Rev. J. A. Russell,
in his "Remains of C. Wolfe" (London, 1829),
states that a letter is preserved in the Royal
Irish Academy, addressed by the Rev. C. Wolfe
to John Taylor, Esq., at the Rev. Mr. Armstrong's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Clononty, Cashel, in which he says:&mdash;"I have
completed the 'Burial of Sir John Moore,' and
will here inflict it upon you." This letter bears
the post mark "September 9, 1816."</p>

<p>Yet although the poem was quickly copied
into all the newspapers, and at once became
widely popular, its authorship long remained
the subject of controversy. By some it was
ascribed to Lord Byron, whilst Shelley was
inclined to name Thomas Campbell as its
author. In 1841, long after the death of Wolfe,
it was dishonestly claimed by a Scotch teacher,
Mr. Macintosh, who ungenerously sought to
pluck the laurel from the grave of its owner.</p>

<p>The friends of Wolfe came forward, and
established his right to the poem; the impostor
was compelled to withdraw his claim, and
apologise for his misconduct.</p>

<p>Of the numerous claims to the authorship of
these lines the most striking was that advanced
by the Rev. Francis Mahony ("Father Prout")
in "Bentley's Miscellany," Vol. 1, p. 96, 1837:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. Wolfe is <em>supposed</em> to be the author of a
single poem, unparalleled in the English language for all
the qualities of a true lyric, breathing the purest spirit of the
antique, and setting criticism completely at defiance. I say
<em>supposed</em>, for the gentleman himself never claimed its
authorship during his short and unobtrusive lifetime. He
who could write the "Funeral of Sir John Moore" must
have eclipsed all the lyric poets of this latter age by the
fervour and brilliancy of his powers. Do the other writings
of Mr. Wolfe bear any trace of inspiration? None.</p>

<p>"I fear we must look elsewhere for the origin of those
beautiful lines; and I think I can put the public on the
right scent. In 1749, Colonel de Beaumanoir, a native of
Brittany, having raised a regiment in his own neighbourhood,
went out with it to India, in that unfortunate expedition,
commanded by Lally-Tolendal, the failure of which
eventually lost to the French their possessions in Hindostan.
The colonel was killed in defending against the forces of
Coote, P<span class="smcapa">ONDICHERRY</span>, the last stronghold of the French in
that hemisphere.</p>

<p>"He was buried that night on the north bastion of the
fortress by a few faithful followers, and the next day the fleet
sailed with the remainder of the garrison for Europe. In
the appendix to the "Memoirs of L<span class="smcapa">ALLY</span>-T<span class="smcapa">OLENDAL</span>" by
his son, the following lines occur, which bear some resemblance
to those attributed to Wolfe. Perhaps Wolfe Tone
may have communicated them to his relative, the clergyman,
on his return from France. <em>Fides sit penes lectorem.</em>"</p>

<p>This "Father Prout," whom Mr. G. A. Sala
terms "the wittiest pedant, the most pedantic
wit, and the oddest fish he ever met with," was
well known as an inveterate jester, as well as an
accomplished linguist, so that the above effusion
did not deceive his associates, especially as the
documents referred to in it, as evidence, had no
existence save in the fertile brain of "Father
Prout."</p>

<p>In the recent edition of the "Maclise Portrait
Gallery," by Mr. William Bates, M.A. (Chatto
and Windus, 1883), is an interesting biography
of this eccentric genius, in which will be found
all that is known about his French imitation of
Wolfe's Ode. Mr. Bates truly remarks that, notwithstanding
Padre Prout's skill in French
versification, there are internal evidences that
the poem was not written by a Frenchman, and
further that it has the unmistakable air of a
translation. Unfortunately, however, the mischief
was done, and what Mahony may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
intended for a harmless pleasantry, has raised a
literary controversy of wide dimensions. His
verses were copied into serious French journals,
and many well-informed foreigners believe the
lines to have originated from a French source.
Thus M. Octave Delepierre, in his <em>Essai sur la
Parodie</em> (Trübner and Co., London, 1870), seems
to have been entirely misled by the hoax. He
gives part of the French version, and whilst
stating that it is not a settled point, which was
first written, he does not mention Father Prout's
article, and seems entirely ignorant of the
fictitious and humorous origin of the French
imitation.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, <cite>The Athenæum</cite>, of July 1,
1871, in reviewing M. Delepierre's work, fell
into the same error, and seriously argued
against the French claim, forgetting all about
Father Prout.</p>

<p>M. Delepierre's statement is (<em>Essai sur la
Parodie</em>, p. 163):&mdash;"Lorsqu'elle fut publiée en
1824, elle parut assez belle pour que le Capitaine
Medwin suggérat qu'elle était due à la
muse de <em>Byron</em>. Sydney Taylor réfuta cette
supposition, et restitua l'ode à son véritable
auteur, le <em>Rev. Charles Wolfe</em>."</p>

<p>"Ce n'est pas seulement en Angleterre qu'on a
discuté la paternité de cette ode célèbre. On
trouve à ce sujet toute une discussion littéraire
dans le journal <cite>L'Intermédiare des Chercheurs et
Curieux</cite>, 5ᵉ année, page 693, et 6ᵉ année, pages
19 et 106."</p>

<p>"D'après ces détails, il paraîtrait que cette
pièce n'est que la traduction d'une ode Française,
composée à l'occasion de la mort du Comte de
Beaumanoir, tué en 1749, à la défense de Pondichery.
L'une de ces deux odes est évidemment
une traduction de l'autre; mais quel est
l'original?"</p>

<p>The following is the note in the <em>Intermédiare</em>,
to which M. Delepierre refers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The well-known verses on the death of Sir John Moore,
attributed to the Rev. Charles Wolfe, but never acknowledged
by him, are so similar to the above, that it is supposed
Mr. Wolfe may have received the French stanzas from
his relative, Mr. Wolfe Tone, after his return from France."</p></blockquote>

<p>The best answer to which is, that the French
have never yet produced a genuine and authentic
copy of the original version, of a date earlier
than that of Wolfe.</p>

<p>The ode has been translated into German (by
the Rev. E. C. Hawtrey); into Latin Elegiacs
(by the Rev. J. Hildyard); and there is a Greek
translation of it "By a Scottish Physician" in
the <cite>Arundines Devæ</cite> (Edinburgh, 1853); there is
also a parody of it by the late Mr. J. H. Dixon,
which is highly spoken of, but, up till now,
this has eluded the editor's researches.</p>

<p>The Rev. R. H. Barham's well known parody
in "The Ingoldsby Legends" is especially
notable for its close imitation of the original;
thus not only is the metre closely followed, but
nearly all the lines are made to end with
similar rhymes to those in the original.</p>

<p>Barham had a good excuse for this comical
effusion, in the wish to expose and ridicule the
pretensions of a certain <em>soi-disant</em> "Doctor," a
Durham veterinary surgeon of the name of
Marshall, on whose behalf a claim had been
made, in 1824, for the authorship of the "Ode."
But this was afterwards said to have been a
mere hoax, as this Marshall was more remarkable
for convivial, than literary tastes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Note.&mdash;In the autumn of 1824, Captain Medwin having
hinted that certain beautiful lines on the burial of this gallant
officer might have been the production of Lord Byron's
muse, the late Mr. Sydney Taylor, somewhat indignantly,
claimed them for their rightful owner, the late Rev. Charles
Wolfe. During the controversy a third claimant started up
in the person of a <em>soi-disant</em> "Doctor Marshall," who
turned out to be a Durham blacksmith, and his pretensions a
hoax. It was then that a certain "Doctor Peppercorn" put
forth <em>his</em> pretensions to what he averred was the only "true
and original" version, viz.:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

No date is given, but that it was prior to 1830
is shown by the reference to the "Charleys," a
nick-name for the old London watchmen, who
were superseded by the new police towards the
end of 1829. But the crimes of Body-snatching,
and "Burking," were not finally put a stop to

<p>"G<span class="smcapa">ENERAL</span> O'N<span class="smcapa">EILL</span>, who, at the head of the Fenian
forces recently invaded Canada, seems to combine, together
with his love for Ireland, a certain amount of affection for
the ordinary enjoyments of life; for one complaint against
him is, that the morning of the attack, when awakened at
three o'clock by a captain belonging to his quarters, he
merely said, "All right!" and fell asleep again. On two
subsequent occasions he was awakened with no more practical
result, and on being called a fourth time, got up.
Even then, however, he declined to proceed at once with the
glorious work of liberating Ireland, but said, "He guessed
he would wait till breakfast." After breakfast this great
patriot advanced at the head of his forces, but being surprised
by a party of Canadian Volunteers, who fired upon the
Fenians, immediately retired to his quarters, where he was
found very comfortably lodged, and was arrested by General
Foster, the United States Marshal, for a breach of the
neutrality laws."</p>

<p>This critic, who left the theatre before the
tragedy was half over, was, of course, eminently
qualified to point out the shortcomings of Mr.
Irving in the part of <em>Macbeth</em>, But perhaps the
critic had forgotten that the leading character
has one, or two, rather strong situations towards
the end of the play, which he should have witnessed
before condemning the actor.</p>

<p>One of the arguments against Mr. Disraeli's
Titles Bill, was that <em>Empress</em> was likely altogether
to supersede the older, and more constitutional,
title of <em>Queen</em>. The lapse of but a few
years has shown how groundless was this
apprehension, for except in state documents or
Daily Telegraph leaders, the title of Empress is
never employed.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the time when the above parody appeared
there was an agitation on foot to reform the
costliness and vain display at funerals. <em>Punch</em>,
both in his cartoons and his letterpress, was
exceedingly bitter against the undertakers.</p>

<p>The matter was so energetically taken up by
the press and the public, that funerals were
soon shorn of their costly mummery, and are
now conducted on much more sensible and
economical principles than they were in 1850.</p>

<p>In reference to the disputed authority of the
ode "Not a drum was heard," the Rev. T. W.
Carson, of Dublin, has kindly forwarded a <em>facsimile</em>
of the letter, (to which reference was made
on page 105), from the Rev. C. Wolfe to his friend
Mr. John Taylor. It varies slightly from the
version already given, and seems conclusively
to establish Wolfe's title as author of the poem.</p>

<p>It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have completed the Burial of Sir John Moore, and will
here inflict it upon you; you have no one but yourself to
blame, for praising the two stanzas (?) that I told you so
much;&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>Here follows the poem.</em>)</p>

<p>"Pray write soon&mdash;you may direct as usual to College,
and it will follow me to the country. Give my love to
Armstrong, and believe me, my dear John, ever yours,</p>

<p class="center">(Signed) C<span class="smcapa">HARLES</span> W<span class="smcapa">OLFE</span>."</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_HOOD" id="THOMAS_HOOD"></a>Thomas Hood.</h2>

<p class="p6">1798&mdash;MAY 3, 1845.</p>


<p>In Hood's poems a rare blending is found of
wit, fancy, humour and pathos; and as his personal
character was amiable, gentle and good,
his memory is cherished by Englishmen with
peculiar affection and respect.</p>

<p>Thomas Hood was born in London, and was
the son of a member of the then well-known
firm of booksellers, Vernor, Hood, and Sharp.</p>

<p>Hood was intended for an engraver, and
although he soon deserted that profession, he
acquired a sufficient knowledge of it to enable
him to illustrate his own works, which he did in
a quaintly comical manner. His sketches,
though generally crude and inartistic, admirably
explain his meaning, and never certainly did
puns find such a prolific, and humourous, pictorial
exponent as Hood.</p>

<p>Hood's eldest son (Thomas Hood the younger)
was also the author of several novels and
some humourous poetry. He was for many
years editor of <em>Fun</em>.</p>

<p>Of Hood's poems the four most usually selected
for parody and imitation are, <em>The Song of the Shirt;</em>
<em>The Bridge of Sighs;</em> <em>The Dream of Eugene Aram;</em>
and a pretty little piece entitled <em>I remember, I
remember</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a somewhat curious fact that one of the
most earnest and pathetic of Hood's poems should
first have appeared in <em>Punch</em>. <em>The Song of the
Shirt</em> will be found on page 260 of vol. 5, 1843,
of that journal.</p>

<p>This dirge of misery awoke universal pity for
the poor victims of the slop-sellers and ready-made
clothiers; but like most of the spasmodic
outbursts of British rage and indignation little
permanent good resulted from it. The machinists,
and unattached out-door employés of
the London tailors, are probably worse off now
than ever they were in Hood's time.</p>

<p>As might have been expected from the wonderful
popularity of <em>The Song of the Shirt</em> and its
peculiarly catching rhythm, it has been the
subject of almost innumerable parodies, and has
also served as the model for many imitations of
a serious nature.</p>

<p>Another parody of the same original appeared
in <em>The Figaro</em> for August 26, 1874. It was
entitled, "I Remember, I Remember, a reminiscence
of Child-Hood and Thomas Hood," and
consisted of four verses, but they are not now
of sufficient interest to be quoted.</p>

<p>The peculiar rhythm, and quaint conceits of
fancy, in Hood's <em>Miss Kilmansegg and her Precious
Leg</em> have been admirably imitated by Mr. H.
Cholmondeley Pennell in <em>The Thread of Life</em>.
This poem (the last in <em>Puck on Pegasus</em>) resembles
its original also in the exquisite blending of the
pathetic and the humorous, of which, unfortunately,
disjointed extracts can give but a faint
idea:&mdash;</p>

peculiarities of style of such varied writers as
Miss Braddon, Victor Hugo, Charles Lever,
Lord Lytton, Alexander Dumas, F. Cooper,
Captain Marryat, Charles Dickens, Charlotte
Brontë, and Wilkie Collins; whilst in <em>Lothaw</em>
he produced a clever little parody of Lord
Beaconsfield's <em>Lothair</em>.</p>

<p>Bret Harte has ably described both the comic
and the pathetic sides of the wild life of the
Californian miners, with which he is thoroughly
familiar; and his best known poems deal with
phases of life in that part of the world, where the
Chinese element enters largely into the population.
For convenience of comparison, the
original "Heathen Chinee" is given below,
followed by the parodies:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two old parodies of the same original, on
theatrical matters, may also, for the sake of
completeness, be inserted here. They are both
taken from <em>The Man in the Moon</em>, which was a
small comic magazine, edited by the late Angus
B. Reach, with many funny illustrations by
Hine, Sala, and other humorous artists. <em>The
Man in the Moon</em> was started in 1847, and five
volumes in all were issued; its contents are
now, of course, somewhat out of date, but there
are some clever parodies which will be inserted
in this collection&mdash;many of these parodies were,
no doubt, from the facile pen of Albert Smith,
who was one of the principal contributors to the
magazine.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> first four parts of this collection were
devoted to parodies of the works of the Poet
Laureate, a few examples being given of the
imitations of each of his more important poems.
Numerous subscribers have requested that the
collection should be continued, so that the first
volume might contain as nearly a complete set
of parodies on Tennyson's works as it is possible
to form. With this view many additional contributions
have been sent in; whilst some that
have quite recently appeared, and a few that
were previously omitted as being too lengthy,
will now be included. Independently of the
amusing nature of many of the parodies still to
be given, collectors of <em>Tennysoniana</em> will appreciate
the completeness thus to be obtained, and
it will be seen that very few of Tennyson's
poems have escaped parody.</p>

<p>Although it may appear that the imitations
now to be given will come somewhat out of
order, no inconvenience will eventually result,
as the index will show, in a tabulated form,
under the head of each <em>original</em> poem every
parody of it. The order adopted in the recent
editions of the Laureate's poems will be followed
in this further collection, and the parodies
will illustrate Mariana; Circumstance; The
Palace of Art; Riflemen Form; Lady Clara
Vere de Vere; The May Queen; The Dream of
Fair Women; "You Ask Me Why;" "Of Old
Sat Freedom;" Tithonus; Locksley Hall; Lady
Godiva; The Lord of Burleigh; The Voyage;
Enoch Arden; The Brook; The Princess;
Alexandra; In Memoriam; Maud; Hands All

<p>The following poem appeared in <em>The Times</em>
for May 9, 1859, and although not included in
the collected works of the Poet Laureate, it has
been generally ascribed to his pen. In its
warlike promptings, and cheap national bunkum,
it resembles the other so-called patriotic songs
of this author, of whom nobody ever heard that
he took up a rifle for his country, or assisted
the Volunteer movement in any way whatever:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Poet Laureate has been subjected to
much ridicule for the change which has of late
years been apparent in the tone of his writings,
and his poem, "Lady Clara Vere de Vere," has
especially been seized on as the vehicle for
many malicious parodies directed against the
fulsome adulation of Royalty, contained in his
later poems.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that "Lady Clara
Vere de Vere" was written more than fifty
years ago, when Alfred Tennyson was young,
unknown, and unpensioned. Like many of
his early poems, it contains uncomplimentary
allusions to our hereditary aristocracy, into
whose ranks he has only recently procured admission.</p>

<p>The heartless coquette, Lady Clara, is "the
daughter of a hundred Earls," and in her name
the poet actually selected one of the oldest in
the English nobility on which to vent his
indignation. The Vere (or De Vere) family is
of great antiquity, once holding the ancient
Earldom of Oxford, and as far back as 1387 one
of these Earls of Oxford was created Duke of
Ireland, and Marquis of Dublin. It is certain the
De Veres were noble in the time of William I.,
and their pedigree has even been traced to a
much earlier period. "De Vere" still survives
as one of the family names of the Duke of St.
Albans. The first Duke of St. Albans (illegitimate
son of Charles II. and Nell Gwynn, the
orange girl), married Diana de Vere, eldest
daughter and heiress of Aubrey de Vere, the
20th and last Earl of Oxford.</p>

<p>Another parody of "Lady Clara Vere de
Vere" appeared in <em>Funny Folks</em>, April 10, 1875,
entitled "The Vicar's Surplice." It was addressed
to a Rev. Mr. Mucklestone, who had
declined to pay the charges of his laundress, a
lady rejoicing in the euphonious name of
Gubbins, who resided at Haseley, in Warwickshire.
The subject is somewhat wanting in
dignity for poetical treatment. The following is
the first of six verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Reverend Mr. Mucklestone,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of me you shall not win renown;</div>
  <div class="i0">You thought to have your surplice washed</div>
  <div class="i0">For nothing, but it won't go down.</div>
  <div class="i0">At me you smiled, but unbeguiled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each time your surplice had a 'rense,'</div>
  <div class="i0">I charged, and felt quite justified,</div>

<p>"That large numbers of women&mdash;numbers that every year
are rapidly increasing&mdash;demand a University training is not a
matter of controversy; it is a simple fact. This training is
already offered to them by University College, London,
and by Cambridge University. The hall-mark of the degree
is offered to them by the University of London, and a
certificate of having passed the Tripos Examinations (almost
as valuable as a degree) is offered to them by the University
of Cambridge. The last Census shows that there were in
Great Britain and Ireland more than 120,000 women
teachers. To many of these a University degree or certificate
is of the highest professional importance. This is a
question to many women, not of sentiment, but of bread.
Those whose generosity has provided scholarships, exhibitions,
and a loan fund for women at Cambridge could prove
how invaluable to many a woman a University training is.
Equipped with her University certificate she can at once
obtain a situation, and command a much more adequate
remuneration for her services. Cambridge has had twelve
years' experience of the presence of women students resident
in Newnham and Girton Colleges. They number now in
the two Colleges about 150. Nearly all the professors'
lectures are open to them; they attend some of the lectures
given in College rooms. When the experiment was first
started at Cambridge there is little doubt that the bulk of
the residents thought the presence of women students
objectionable and alarming. But the fears at first entertained
were at Cambridge so entirely removed by experience that
when, in 1881, the question had to be decided by the Senate
of opening the Tripos examinations to the students of Girton
and Newnham, only thirty members of the Senate were
found to oppose it, while those who supported it were so
numerous that it was impossible to record all the votes
within the time and under the conditions prescribed. It was
estimated that about 500 members of the Senate came up to
Cambridge to vote in favour of the proposal. More than 300
actually voted.</p></blockquote>

<p>The two Parodies, from which the following
extracts are taken, appeared in <em>The Porcupine</em>, a
Liverpool comic paper.</p>

<p>They refer to the Cart Horse procession held
in Liverpool on May-day, and describe, with
tolerable accuracy, the scenes of rough revelry
and noisy merriment which this carnival gives
rise to. These compositions are merely quoted
as curiosities, possessing, as they do, every
attribute which should be studiously avoided in
a parody. They are slangy and vulgar, more
especially in the omitted verses, without being
either humorous or grotesque; they debase
the memory of a really beautiful poem by the
mere trick of repetition of a catch-phrase and
some slight imitation of its metre. The subject
chosen is low and commonplace, which might,
perhaps, have been excused, had the description
of its unpleasant details been enlivened by one
spark of wit, or genuine originality. To the
lovers of an original poem such Parodies must
be offensive; whilst to those who delight in a
really clever burlesque, such things as these can
afford no gratification, and only tend to bring
<em>true Parody</em> into disrepute.</p>

<p>The following parody appeared originally in a
clever little Cambridge University Magazine,
entitled <em>Light Green</em>, which has long been out of
print. <em>Light Green</em> contained many excellent
parodies, notable amongst them being:&mdash;<em>The
May Exam.</em>, after Tennyson; <em>The Song of the
Shirk</em>, after Hood; <em>The Heathen Pass-ee</em>, after
Bret Harte; and <em>The Vulture and the Husbandman</em>,
after Lewis Carroll. These, with several
other amusing pieces of poetry, have been
reprinted in a small pamphlet, which can be
obtained from W. Metcalfe and Son, Trinity-street,
Cambridge.</p>

<p>As this parody refers to a nearly-forgotten
play, the allusions in it may best be explained
by the reproduction of the Play-bill, which has
now become a literary curiosity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The drama was a complete and melancholy
failure; even George Augustus Sala, most lenient
and genial of critics, could not but condemn it,
as being as unactable a play as Shelley's "Cenci,"
or Swinburne's "Bothwell," or Southey's "Wat
Tyler," whilst it possessed none of the literary
merits of either of those compositions. He
added, "It is finally and most wretchedly
unfortunate that an illustrious English poet has
not by his side some really candid and judicious
friend, with influence enough, and courage
enough, to persuade him to desist from subjecting
this disastrous production to the ordeal
of representation before a miscellaneous audience."</p>

<p>Bad as <em>The Promise of May</em> was, it contained
one leading idea, which, from the very opposition
it gave rise to, enabled the management to
keep the play on the boards much longer than
could have been anticipated. The plot had been
foreshadowed in one of Tennyson's earliest
poems, <em>The Sisters:</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>Assuming that Mrs. Bernard-Beere, as <em>Dora
Steer</em>, speaks these lines, we have the counterpart
of the villainously seductive Earl in <em>Philip
Edgar</em>, a thankless part, which was admirably
played by Mr. Hermann Vezin. This <em>Edgar</em>,
having ruined and abandoned one sister,
returns, after an interval of five or six years, to
the scene of his former conquest, and lays siege
to the heart of the other sister; confidentially
informing the audience that he intends to marry
<em>Dora</em> as an atonement for the injuries he has
inflicted on the luckless <em>Eva</em>. The shouts of
derisive laughter with which this announcement
(the culmination of absurdity), was met on the
first night, led Mr. Hermann Vezin to somewhat
modify his language on the following evenings,
but he was still compelled to inflict on the
audience the most tedious and extraordinary
soliloquies touching Communism, Free-love,
Agnosticism, and other wholly undramatic
topics. For Tennyson had, with characteristic
bigotry, chosen to assume that a Freethinker
must necessarily be a villain; and with a view
of generally condemning opinions distasteful to
him, had burdened poor Edgar with the task of
proclaiming himself at once as a seducer, a
hypocrite, a liar, a coward, a Freethinker, an
Agnostic, a Secularist, a Democrat&mdash;and all this
in speeches of a contradictory and decidedly
tiresome description.</p>

<p>On the third representation of the drama the
Marquis of Queensberry, who occupied a seat in
the stalls, rose, and loudly protested against the
Laureate's misrepresentation of the principles
of freethought as a gross caricature, especially
in regard to Edgar's sentiments about the law of
marriage.</p>

<p>He subsequently addressed a letter to <em>The
Globe</em>, containing the following explanation:&mdash;</p>


<h3>"THE PROMISE OF MAY."</h3>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITOR OF THE GLOBE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"S<span class="smcapa">IR</span>,&mdash;In reply to Mr. Hermann Vezin's letter, which
appears in your issue of to-day, may I be allowed to make a
few remarks? He says that on the first night 'some one
started a hiss, which soon grew into a storm,' &amp;c., and he
continues to say, 'it is to be presumed that this opposition
came from professing orthodox Christian people. On the
third night the Marquis of Queensberry, a professed Freethinker,
rose in his stall, and loudly protested against what
he considered a caricature of his own sect.' Not a caricature
against my own sect, Sir, which is Secularism, but against
an infamous libel to the whole body of people who have been
designated by that name of Freethinkers. Mr. Hermann
Vezin says, here we have a curious spectacle of the most
outspoken opposition from both extremes, and that neither
party has quite caught Mr. Tennyson's meaning. Whether
two separate parties spoke (or only one, as I expect is the
case) it would be as well if Mr. Tennyson himself would
explain what his meaning is; for, coming so soon after the
poem, which he issued to the public a short time ago,
entitled 'Despair,' we Freethinkers can have but one opinion
as to what his meaning is, and that is to caricature and to
misrepresent what the outcome of freethought has led to in
its secession from orthodoxy. My object the other night in
causing an 'interruption' at the theatre was not only to
make a public protest against the supposed sentiments of a
Freethinker (on marriage), but to attract public attention to
that protest, and I consider that the end justified the means,
considering the difficulty that we have in getting a hearing
from those who oppose us, and not only who oppose us, but
who misrepresent us. Freethinkers may not be satisfied
with the present marriage law&mdash;as I explained the other day
in my letter to the <em>Daily News</em>&mdash;but that is no reason that
they should not respect marriage, and we cannot be attacked
on a more tender point, from the very delicacy there is to
speak on the subject.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="center">"Q<span class="smcapa">UEENSBERRY.</span></p>

<p class="center">"45, Half Moon-street, Piccadilly, November 20, 1882."</p></blockquote>

<p>This led to a discussion in the newspapers on
Tennyson's muddled metaphysics and absurd
theories; public curiosity was thus aroused, and
the management was enabled to run the play
much longer than could have been expected
from its original reception.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> (November 25, 1882) had a long and
elaborate criticism of the play, giving a humorous
analysis of the plot. The opening and closing
paragraphs are much to the point, especially as
they include two amusing parodies.</p>


<h3>N<span class="smcapa">EITHER</span> R<span class="smcapa">HYME NOR</span> R<span class="smcapa">EASON</span>;</h3>

<p class="center"><em>Or, Promise of May, and Performance of November
at the Globe.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> sources of literary ambition are proverbially obscure,
and it is scarcely worth while to enquire why the Laureate,
who has spent a lifetime in filling the world with his verse,
should, at the eleventh hour, have conceived the idea of
emptying the Globe with his prose. If there could be any
doubt that he had not only done so, but also had set himself
to the business with a right good will, the hearty and sympathetic
jeers of the not unkindly audience that attended the first
performance of his <em>Promise</em> the other evening must have
settled the matter. Indeed, some of the Poet's own lines&mdash;or
something like them&mdash;seemed to occur to everybody.
Even his staunchest admirers could be heard in the lobbies
between the acts respectfully quoting to each other&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'I hold it truth that he who flings</div>
  <div class="i1">His harp aside, to try the bones,</div>
  <div class="i1">Will somehow find that paving stones,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are levelled at his neatest things.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the way, the management might even now take a hint
from a rival establishment, and try this on a poster.</p>

<p>"The plot of the piece is simplicity itself, and if the
talented author had merely contented himself with working
out his pretty little idyl in some ordinary and unpretentious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
fashion, there could hardly have been any doubt about the
result. But he went further than this, and in some inspired
moment appears to have conceived the brilliant and happy
idea of spicing his whole story, from beginning to end, with
the wildest and most boisterous fun.</p>

<p>"Not that his purpose was distinctly apparent on the
first go off of his piece in a Lincolnshire farm; for the serious
utterances of several gloomy rustics for a few moments filled
the house almost with awe.</p>

<p>"However, with so much genuine pantomime go for the
finish in reserve, very possibly the author knew what he was
about. And he was not at fault. He must have realised
what depths of quiet fun would be stirred when placing
Mrs. B<span class="smcapa">ERNARD</span>-B<span class="smcapa">EERE</span> over the dead body of <em>Eva</em>, he made
her, in so many words, courteously request <em>Farmer Dobson</em>
and the comic agnostic <em>Edgar</em> to consider themselves quite
at home, and not mind the corpse, as she had a few general
remarks to make that wouldn't take her much more than
five-and-twenty minutes.</p>

<p>"But there,&mdash;the matter really defies sober criticism, and,
taking his own charming lines from the bill, the story is soon
told:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'The Town booked well for the opening night,</div>

management.</p>

<p>"But <em>The Promise of May</em> must be an Utter Frost, with,

up again."</p></blockquote>

<p>When Lord Burghley, M.P. (son of the
Marquis of Exeter), took the English farmers
to task for allowing their daughters to play
the piano, and to learn a few of the polite little
accomplishments of the day, his remarks were
generally resented as impertinent, and his name
lent itself irresistibly to the ridicule contained
in the preceding parody of Tennyson's "Lord
of Burleigh." Inasmuch as Tennyson's poem
was founded on incidents connected with the
courtship and marriage of the first Marquis of
Exeter, to Sarah Hoggins, the daughter of a
small yeoman farmer at Bolas Magna, in Shropshire.
The marriage took place in October,
1791, and the lady died in January, 1797, leaving
two sons, of whom the elder became the second
Marquis of Exeter, and was the grandfather
of the Lord Burghley above referred to.</p>

<p>Tennyson's "Enoch Arden" has been less
frequently parodied than most of his poems;
some years ago the Australian Punch had a
clever burlesque of it, and a "continuation" of
Enoch Arden was privately printed in 1866.
This very scarce little pamphlet consisted of
twelve pages, in a blue wrapper, and had no
printer's name or place on it. As it is now
eagerly sought after by collectors of Tennysoniana,
it is here given in full:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">So Enoch died, as he had lived so long.</div>
  <div class="i0">Alone&mdash;alone! for Miriam Lane had pass'd</div>
  <div class="i0">To an adjoining chamber; but she heard</div>
  <div class="i0">Those joyous dying words, "A sail! a sail!</div>
  <div class="i0">I'm sav'd," and hurried back to comfort him;</div>
  <div class="i0">But wist not that the "sail" his spirit saw</div>
  <div class="i0">Was God's own ark, propell'd by angel wings</div>
  <div class="i0">Towards the Ocean of Eternity.</div>
  <div class="i1">"Ah well!" she said; "poor Enoch! he is gone;</div>
  <div class="i0">God rest his soul: give him more joy in Heaven</div>
  <div class="i0">Than he had found on earth,&mdash;at least of late:</div>
  <div class="i0">I thought he had not long to linger here,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sea made such a moaning all the night:</div>
  <div class="i0">It sounded like his death-wail; and methought</div>
  <div class="i0">I saw the corpse-light dancing in the fen.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now will I tell the neighbours who he was:</div>
  <div class="i0">They'll wonder how Dame Miriam knew the truth,</div>
  <div class="i0">But kept it close, because she loved her friend</div>
  <div class="i0">Enoch:&mdash;they cannot call me gossip now."</div>
  <div class="i1">It chanced that day, that Philip left his mill</div>
  <div class="i0">Earlier than wont: the nutting-time was come,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That season of the year so closely link'd</div>
  <div class="i0">To Philip's destiny;&mdash;it seem'd to stir</div>
  <div class="i0">His pulse to quicker beat, and send a thrill</div>
  <div class="i0">Of strange mysterious feeling thro' his veins.</div>
  <div class="i0">He knew not how, or why: but Philip hurried on</div>
  <div class="i0">That he might keep the promised holiday</div>
  <div class="i0">With all the children&mdash;his, and hers, and theirs&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">All dear to him; nor least the bonny Ralph,</div>
  <div class="i0">That last wee prattler, climbing to his knee.</div>
  <div class="i0">And all were ready with their nutting crooks;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Annie Ray, his own, his wife at last,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">His "beam of sunshine," as he called her oft.</div>
  <div class="i0">But as he left his mill, the passing-bell,</div>
  <div class="i0">With its first startling boom, tolled on his ear.</div>
  <div class="i0">It is a sound that enters at the brain,</div>
  <div class="i0">A saddening augury of woe, and strikes</div>
  <div class="i0">The inmost chord of sympathising hearts</div>
  <div class="i0">That fondly breathe an echoing sigh of pain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sudden it falls, chilly as winter's frost,</div>
  <div class="i0">Turning to icicles the heart's warm blood.</div>
  <div class="i1">Spoke Philip to the comrade at his side,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Know you for whom that passing-bell is struck?</div>
  <div class="i0">Some full-grown man: it is the minute-toll."</div>
  <div class="i0">"Mayhap the stranger down at Miriam Lane's;</div>
  <div class="i0">I heard that he was dying yester-e'en.</div>
  <div class="i0">The tide has turn'd but now: 'tis running out;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoe'er he was, his soul upon the shore</div>
  <div class="i0">Waited the ebbing tide to ebb away."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then came they to a little knot of men</div>
  <div class="i0">(Fishers in dark-blue knitted woollen vests)</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard by "the idle corner,"&mdash;so 'twas called,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The blacksmith's forge. The honest gossippers,</div>
  <div class="i0">As Philip pass'd along, hushed their voices.</div>
  <div class="i0">Could he have read their looks, he might have known</div>
  <div class="i0">Some dark o'er-clouding sorrow was at hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">More nigh than he could think for, and more hard.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then passed a woman from the ale-house door,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, all unwitting Philip was so near,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cried, "Have you heard who died just now?</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas Enoch Arden,&mdash;lost, but late returned;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Miriam Lane has known it all along!"</div>
  <div class="i0">As if some hand had struck a sudden blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Philip seemed stunned: the blood forsook his cheek,</div>
  <div class="i0">The big cold drops stood out upon his brow,</div>
  <div class="i0">As on the victim's, stretched upon the rack.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His comrade laid his hand on Philip's arm,</div>
  <div class="i0">And uttering no word (what could he say?)</div>
  <div class="i0">Led him, as one half-blinded, step by step,</div>
  <div class="i0">Until they reached the home, where Annie Ray,</div>
  <div class="i0">Poor widow-wife, sat watching his return;</div>
  <div class="i0">He stagger'd towards her, caught her in his arms:</div>
  <div class="i0">God help me,&mdash;kiss me darling,&mdash;wife look up!</div>
  <div class="i0">"My wife&mdash;his wife&mdash;I know not what I say:</div>
  <div class="i0">If we did sin it was unwittingly;</div>
  <div class="i0">O, Annie! darling, one more fond embrace,</div>
  <div class="i0">E'er it be said our wedded love was wrong."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, as she wonder'd, gazing on his face,</div>
  <div class="i0">And twined her loving arms around, he told,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yes, told her all&mdash;how Enoch had returned.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Philip's comrade, who had linger'd near,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beckon'd the children out, and closed the door:</div>
  <div class="i0">There Miriam met them, with the lock of hair:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, loth to interrupt the sorrowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">She led the children to the house of death;</div>
  <div class="i0">And took a key from off the wooden peg,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beside the settle, where she used to hang</div>
  <div class="i0">The skeins of twine to mend the fishing nets:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then gently led them up the narrow stair,</div>
  <div class="i0">That creaked beneath their stealthy-moving tread.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sacred the silence that we ever keep,</div>
  <div class="i0">When death is in the house! we speak, we walk,</div>
  <div class="i0">With muffled tone and step, as if the dead</div>
  <div class="i0">Could be disturb'd, and waken out of sleep.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Miriam turn'd the key;&mdash;that jarring click!</div>
  <div class="i0">How harsh it grated on the children's ear!</div>
  <div class="i0">As do the pebbles on the boat's sharp keel.</div>
  <div class="i0">Cold thro' the open casement came the breeze:</div>
  <div class="i0">There stood the bed&mdash;and on the sacking lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Distinct beneath the sheet, a rigid form&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The feet so prominent, the arms close down!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The children clung together, half afraid,</div>
  <div class="i0">While Miriam turned the coverlid aside.</div>
  <div class="i0">They dar'd not stoop to kiss the pallid face;</div>
  <div class="i0">But gaz'd awhile, then slowly left the room.</div>
  <div class="i0">Once they had seen their brother, as he lay</div>
  <div class="i0">Dead in his little cot: but he had look'd</div>
  <div class="i0">So beautiful asleep, you might have thought</div>
  <div class="i0">Death's angel had but gently turned him round,</div>
  <div class="i0">To rest more quietly: the tiny hands</div>
  <div class="i0">Were clasp'd together, and the face bent down,</div>
  <div class="i0">As resting on the pillow&mdash;not like this,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">So stiff, so cold, so utterly alone.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, as the twilight fell the second day,</div>
  <div class="i0">Another mourner came: she spoke no word:</div>
  <div class="i0">Miriam had put the key within her hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Turning aside, to dash away her tears:</div>
  <div class="i0">The widowed woman went up-stairs alone.</div>
  <div class="i1">One moment gazing on her Enoch's face,</div>
  <div class="i0">She stoop'd to kiss it, putting back the hair,</div>
  <div class="i0">As she had done in life: then kneeling down</div>
  <div class="i0">She pray'd,&mdash;"forgive me,&mdash;pity me,&mdash;Oh God."</div>
  <div class="i0">She touch'd his marble-cold, pale, hand with hers,</div>
  <div class="i0">That bore e'en then the double wedding rings.</div>
  <div class="i0">She laid her aching head upon his breast,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">When from her lips came forth a cry,&mdash;a shriek,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like to a hare's when shot: and Miriam came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bore her senseless from the room of death.</div>
  <div class="i1">'Twas strange how quick the widow's glance had caught</div>
  <div class="i0">Each little circumstance of the chamber,</div>
  <div class="i0">And noted in her loving memory,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">How on the table lay his Bible&mdash;closed:</div>
  <div class="i0">No need had Enoch now of Holy Writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">No need of Gospel Message; for he stood</div>
  <div class="i0">In presence of his S<span class="smcapa">AVIOUR</span>, and his G<span class="smcapa">OD</span>.</div>
  <div class="i0">But had she open'd where the much-worn page</div>
  <div class="i0">Told of the frequent reading, she had seen</div>
  <div class="i0">The marks of blistering tears upon that text,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Whose shall she be in Heav'n? there they marry</div>
  <div class="i0">Not, nor give in marriage, but are angels."</div>
  <div class="i0">There was a fly upon the window pane</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose low monotonous hum she scarcely heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">And that unconscious; but in after years</div>
  <div class="i0">The buzzing of a summer fly recall'd,</div>
  <div class="i0">E'en in her happiest hours, <em>that</em> day,</div>
  <div class="i0">That lonely visit to the bed of death;</div>
  <div class="i0">And cast a moment's shadow o'er her heart.</div>
  <div class="i1">More keenly she remarked the remnant store</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lulling anodynes: ah! bootless all</div>
  <div class="i0">To soothe the fever of his aching brain:</div>
  <div class="i0">The Wise Physician healed him with a touch,</div>
  <div class="i0">(E'en as we lay our hand on ringing glass</div>
  <div class="i0">To still the sound that careless fingers make),</div>
  <div class="i0">And sent a loving angel as his guide</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the dark valley to the realms of joy.</div>
  <div class="i1">There lay his watch, his big round silver watch,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose constant tick had sadly echoed "Home"</div>
  <div class="i0">In all his wanderings; now its pulse was hushed:</div>
  <div class="i0">No need of Time for him: he had Eternity.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">In a fair village on the English coast</div>
  <div class="i0">There dwelt a lad&mdash;they called him Hunky Sam.</div>
  <div class="i0">He was but young&mdash;three years, or may be four,</div>
  <div class="i0">But manly for his age; his appetite</div>
  <div class="i0">For bulls'-eyes, "coker"-nuts, and such light fare</div>
  <div class="i0">Was something awful, even for a boy;</div>
  <div class="i0">But better far than even coker-nuts,</div>
  <div class="i0">He loved a maiden of surpassing grace&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of humble parentage, but very fair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose name euphonious was Susan Ann.</div>
  <div class="i0">The parents of these twain were fisher-folk</div>
  <div class="i0">Of low degree, but honest to a fault.</div>
  <div class="i0">They would not steal the veriest pin, unless</div>
  <div class="i0">They were quite certain they would not be caught.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now Hunky's love for peerless Susan Ann</div>
  <div class="i0">Was felt by her, and given back to Hunk;</div>
  <div class="i0">And as the twain upon the yellow sands</div>
  <div class="i0">Would play, young Sam would say, "Now let us be,</div>
  <div class="i0">As grown-up folks, and we'll pretend we are</div>
  <div class="i0">A wedded pair, and I will be a man,</div>
  <div class="i0">And you, dear Susan Ann, my little wife;</div>
  <div class="i0">And you, go sit within yon gloomy cave,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which we will make believe to be our house,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I'll come staggering in like daddy does,</div>
  <div class="i0">And you can belt me on my flaxen head</div>
  <div class="i0">With this small stick, which we will call a broom&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For that's the way my dad and mammy do."</div>
  <div class="i0">And so they played upon the seashore sand</div>
  <div class="i0">Till Susan Ann had got the thing down fine.</div>
  <div class="i0">And time sped on, and Sam and Susan Ann</div>
  <div class="i0">Were married, and the twain became one flesh.</div>

  <div class="i0">Sam went to sea, and whilst upon a voyage,</div>
  <div class="i0">He read of Enoch Arden and his woes;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And so he soon resolved to do the same</div>
  <div class="i0">As in the book he read that Enoch did.</div>
  <div class="i0">To carry out his plan he sent word home,</div>
  <div class="i0">By trusty shipmate, to his Susan Ann,</div>
  <div class="i0">That he was drowned. He really did not care</div>
  <div class="i0">A great deal for his once-loved Susan Ann,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, when the knot had but been tied a year,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had clearly showed that she could be the boss.</div>
  <div class="i0">So time sped on, and artful Hunky Sam</div>
  <div class="i0">In foreign climates had a jolly time</div>
  <div class="i0">For several years. "I think I'll homeward sail,"</div>
  <div class="i0">One day he said, "and see how Susan Ann</div>
  <div class="i0">Gets on; like Enoch, I will softly glide</div>
  <div class="i0">Towards the cottage there upon the cliff,</div>
  <div class="i0">And see how she makes out with her new man,</div>
  <div class="i0">For she is doubtless wedded once again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Just like that Mrs. Arden in the book."</div>
  <div class="i0">Away he sailed across the sounding surge</div>
  <div class="i0">(A good expression that, but not my own),</div>
  <div class="i0">And soon he reached his village on the coast.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas night. He crept towards the little cot</div>
  <div class="i0">Where once he'd dwelt. A light was burning clear;</div>

<p>"The Charge of the Light Brigade" is still
one of the most popular of Tennyson's poems,
in spite of its many faults, and defective construction.
Some of its lines are, indeed, ridiculous,
whilst many are ungrammatical, but the
metre is pleasing, and the words have the ring
of the battle about them. Tennyson, however, can
claim no credit for these merits, having boldly
appropriated them from Michael Drayton's poem
on the Battle of Agincourt, in which the following
lines occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0a">"They now to fight are gone,</div>
  <div class="i0">Armour on armour shone:</div>
  <div class="i0">Drum now to drum did groan;</div>
  <div class="i1">To hear was to wonder;</div>
  <div class="i0">That with the cries they make,</div>
  <div class="i0">The very earth did shake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Trumpet to trumpet spake,</div>
  <div class="i1">Thunder to thunder."</div>
 </div>

<p>Several parodies of "The Charge of the Light
Brigade" remain to be quoted, in addition to
those already given; indeed, this poem appears
to possess a peculiar attraction for imitators.</p>

<p>The following parody was written on the
occasion of a lecture on "Light" having been
given in Horncastle by the late Dr. H. G.
Ward:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>There have been numerous imitations of <em>In
Memoriam</em>, and Mr. William Dobson, in his
"Poetical Ingenuities," speaking of parodies,
observes:&mdash;"One appeared in <em>Punch</em> a number
of years ago, called 'Ozokerit,' a travesty of
Tennyson's 'In Memoriam,' which has been
considered one of the finest ever written." It
is unquestionably very clever. Singularly enough
it did not appear in the body of <em>Punch</em> at all, but
on the outside wrapper, as an advertisement,
so that many people who have bound sets of
<em>Punch</em> will not find the parody, which was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The parody of <em>In Memoriam</em>, mentioned on
Page 61 as having appeared in the <em>St. James's
Gazette</em> of June 18, 1881, was written by Mr.
H. D. Traill, and has since been re-published,
by Messrs. Blackwood and Sons, in a volume
entitled <em>Recaptured Rhymes</em>. Parodies of D. G.
Rossetti, A. C. Swinburne, and Robert Browning
are contained in the same volume, and will be
quoted when the works of these authors are
reached.</p>

<p>Detached portions of Tennyson's <em>Maud</em>, have
frequently been parodied, but the only case in
which any attempt appears to have been made
to imitate all its varying styles, and phases of
thought, occurs in a small volume published in
1859, entitled <em>Rival Rhymes in Honour of Burns</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mere trick of imitating the
metre only does not constitute a good parody,
and this one lacks both in interest and humour.
It is, besides, very long. The following are
some of its best verses:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">C<span class="smcapa">OMRADES</span>, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the dinner horn.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis the place, and all about it, as of old, the rat and mouse</div>
  <div class="i0">Very loudly squeak and nibble, running over Granny's house;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Granny's house, with all its cupboards, and its rooms as neat as wax,</div>
  <div class="i0">And its chairs of wood unpainted, where the old cats rubbed their backs.</div>
  <div class="i0">Many a night from yonder garret window, ere I went to rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Did I see the cows and horses come in slowly from the west;</div>
  <div class="i0">Many a night I saw the chickens, flying upward through the trees,</div>
  <div class="i0">Roosting on the sleety branches, when I thought their feet would freeze;</div>
  <div class="i0">Here about the garden wandered, nourishing a youth sublime</div>
  <div class="i0">With the beans, and sweet potatoes, and the melons which were prime;</div>
  <div class="i0">When the pumpkin-vines behind me with their precious fruit reposed,</div>
  <div class="i0">When I clung about the pear-tree, for the promise that it closed.</div>
  <div class="i0">When I dipt into the dinner far as human eye could see,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saw the vision of the pie, and all the dessert that would be.</div>
  <div class="i0">In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;</div>
  <div class="i0">In the spring the noisy pullet gets herself another nest;</div>
  <div class="i0">In the spring a livelier spirit makes the ladies' tongues more glib;</div>
  <div class="i0">In the spring a young boy's fancy lightly hatches up a fib.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then her cheek was plump and fatter than should be for one so old,</div>
  <div class="i0">And she eyed my every motion, with a mute intent to scold.</div>
  <div class="i0">And I said, "My worthy Granny, now I speak the truth to thee,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Better believe it,&mdash;I have eaten all the apples from one tree."</div>
  <div class="i0">On her kindling cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,</div>
  <div class="i0">As I have seen the rosy red flashing in the northern night;</div>
  <div class="i0">And she turned,&mdash;her fist was shaken at the coolness of the lie;</div>
  <div class="i0">She was mad, and I could see it, by the snapping of her eye,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do thee wrong,"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Saying, "I shall whip you, Sammy, whipping I shall go it strong."</div>
  <div class="i0">She took me up, and turned me pretty roughly, when she'd done,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every time she shook me, I tried to jerk and run;</div>
  <div class="i0">She took off my little coat, and struck again with all her might,</div>
  <div class="i0">And before another minute, I was free, and out of sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Many a morning, just to tease her, did I tell her stories yet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though her whisper made me tingle, when she told me what I'd get;</div>
  <div class="i0">Many an evening did I see her where the willow sprouts grew thick,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I rushed away from Granny at the touching of her stick.</div>
  <div class="i0">O my Granny, old and ugly, O my Granny's hateful deeds,</div>
  <div class="i0">O the empty, empty garret, O the garden gone to weeds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Crosser than all fancy fathoms, crosser than all songs have sung,</div>
  <div class="i0">I was puppet to your threat, and servile to your shrewish tongue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is it well to wish thee happy, having seen thy whip decline</div>
  <div class="i0">On a boy with lower shoulders, and a narrower back than mine?</div>
  <div class="i0">Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the dinner-horn,</div>
  <div class="i0">They to whom my Granny's whippings were a target for their scorn;</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a mouldered string?</div>
  <div class="i0">I am shamed through all my nature to have loved the mean old thing;</div>
  <div class="i0">Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's spite,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nature made them quicker motions, a considerable sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Woman is the lesser man, and all thy whippings matched with mine</div>
  <div class="i0">Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Here at least when I was little, something, O, for some retreat</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep in yonder crowded city where my life began to beat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where one winter fell my father, slipping off a keg of lard,</div>
  <div class="i0">I was left a trampled orphan, and my case was pretty hard.</div>
  <div class="i0">Or to burst all links of habit, and to wander far and fleet,</div>
  <div class="i0">On from farm-house unto farm-house till I found my Uncle Pete,</div>
  <div class="i0">Larger sheds and barns, and newer, and a better neighbourhood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Greater breadth of field and woodlands, and an orchard just as good.</div>
  <div class="i0">Never comes my Granny, never cuts her willow switches there;</div>
  <div class="i0">Boys are safe at Uncle Peter's, I'll bet you what you dare.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hangs the heavy-fruited pear-tree: you may eat just what you like.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a sort of little Eden, about two miles off the pike.</div>
  <div class="i0">There, methinks, would be enjoyment, more than being quite so near</div>
  <div class="i0">To the place where even in manhood I almost shake with fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">There the passions, cramped no longer, shall have scope and breathing space.</div>
  <div class="i0">I will 'scape that savage woman; she shall never rear my race;</div>
  <div class="i0">Iron-jointed, supple-sinewed, they shall dive and they shall run;</div>
  <div class="i0">She has caught me like a wild-goat, but she shall not catch my son.</div>
  <div class="i0">He shall whistle to the dog, and get the books from off the shelf,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not, with blinded eyesight, cutting ugly whips to whip himself.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fool again, the dream of fancy! no, I don't believe it's bliss,</div>
  <div class="i0">But I'm certain Uncle Peter's is a better place than this.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let them herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of all glorious gains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like the horses in the stables, like the sheep that crop the lanes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let them mate with dirty cousins&mdash;what to me were style or rank,</div>
  <div class="i0">I the heir of twenty acres, and some money in the bank?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not in vain the distance beckons, forward let us urge our load,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let our cart-wheels spin till sundown, ringing down the grooves of road;</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the white dust of the turnpike she can't see to give us chase:</div>
  <div class="i0">Better seven years at Uncle's than fourteen at Granny's place.</div>
  <div class="i0">O, I see the blessed promise of my spirit hath not set!</div>
  <div class="i0">If we once get in the wagon, we will circumvent her yet.</div>
  <div class="i0">Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Granny's farm;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Not for me she'll cut the willows, not at me she'll shake her arm.</div>
  <div class="i0">Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cramming all the blast before it,&mdash;guess it holds a thunderbolt:</div>
  <div class="i0">Wish't would fall on Granny's house, with rain, or hail, or fire, or snow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let me get my horses started Uncle Pete-ward, and I'll go.</div>

by trade, sued the defendant Dalgairns, a Civil Engineer,
for the sum of thirty pounds for the erection of a lavatory.
The defendant made a counter claim of one hundred and
twenty pounds, on the ground that the work being improperly
done, sewer gas escaped into the house, and caused
the illness of six members of the household, and the death
of his son. He, therefore, claimed the doctor's bill and

<p><em>Punch</em> has long been calling attention to the
disgraceful condition of Covent Garden Market,
but hitherto without the slightest success. The
Duke of Bedford appears to totally ignore the
fact that property has its duties, as well as
its privileges; and it seems probable that even
the simplest remedies and improvements on his
estate will be neglected, until public attention
is drawn to the foul market and its adjacent
slums, by the outbreak of some epidemic.</p>

<p>In one of the early Christmas numbers of
<em>Fun</em> there appeared a parody entitled "The
Dream of Unfair Women." It concluded
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"A <span class="smcapa">MAID</span>, blue-stockinged, broke the silence drear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And flashing forth a winning smile, said she:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis long since I have seen a man, come here,</div>
  <div class="i1">Play croquet now with me!'"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"She spooned, and cheated, and had ancles thick.</div>
  <div class="i0">I let her win, the game was such a bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her bright ball quivered at the coloured stick,</div>
  <div class="i1">Touched&mdash;and&mdash;we played no more."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The trick of Tennyson's blank verse, as displayed
in some of his early and lighter poems,
was admirably imitated by Bayard Taylor in
the "Diversions of the Echo Club," (now
published by Messrs. Chatto and Windus).
The parody is entitled "Eustace Green; or,
the Medicine Bottle."</p>

<p>In the second volume of "Echoes from the
Clubs" several instances are given of plagiarisms
committed by Tennyson; whilst in "The Figaro"
of October 27, 1875, whole passages from his
tragedy of Queen Mary are shown to have been
borrowed.</p>

<p>Long extracts from the second scene, of the
second act, are printed side by side with similar
passages taken from the twenty-eighth chapter
of Ainsworth's old novel, "The Tower of
London," showing conclusively that Tennyson
had either appropriated from Ainsworth without
acknowledgment, or that both authors had gone
to the same source for inspiration. Again,
the beauties of "The Idylls of the King" are
generally insisted on without any mention being
made of the fact that in all the main incidents
the poems simply retell the old "History of
King Arthur, and of the Knights of the Round
Table," as compiled by Sir Thomas Malory
more than four centuries ago. Indeed, some of
the most pathetic passages of the old original
have been utterly marred; their simple charm
and quaint pathos being lost in the over elaboration
of detail affected by the Laureate. The
beauty of his blank verse is admitted, and the
Idylls have been frequently parodied. Unfortunately,
most of the parodies are too long to
quote in full in this Part.</p>

  <div class="i0">Shall never more, in any future year,</div>
  <div class="i0">Delight my soul with welcoming to feasts,</div>
  <div class="i0">And taking chairs, as in the year just gone;</div>
  <div class="i0">For my Chief Magistracy perisheth.</div>
  <div class="i0">But now delay not! to the window run,</div>
  <div class="i0">Watch what thou see'st, and lightly bring me word."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then did the bold Sir Soulsby answer make:</div>
  <div class="i0">"No call have I to follow thy behest;</div>
  <div class="i0">Look for thyself&mdash;thine eyes are good as mine!"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">To whom replied M'Arthur, much in wrath:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Ah, miserable and unkind, and untrue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ungrateful Secretary! Woe is me!</div>
  <div class="i0">Authority forgets the late Lord Mayor,</div>
  <div class="i0">When he lies widow'd of official pow'r</div>
  <div class="i0">That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou think'st with thine old master to have done,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wouldst neglect him for the new forthwith.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, for a man may fail in duty once</div>
  <div class="i0">And presently repent him, get thee hence:</div>
  <div class="i0">But if thou spare to go and bring me word,</div>
  <div class="i0">I will arise and clout thee with my hands."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then quickly rose Sir Soulsby, and he ran</div>
  <div class="i0">To the great window by the street, and cried:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Your lordship, I perceive a gallant coach,</div>
  <div class="i0">Drawn by four glossy horses, waits below,</div>
  <div class="i0">With well-fed coachman sitting on the box.</div>
  <div class="i0">And gold-laced lackeys hanging on behind."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then groaned M'Arthur, "Take me to the coach,"</div>
  <div class="i0">So to the coach they came. There lackeys three</div>
  <div class="i0">Leap'd to the ground, and seized his Lordship's arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hitch'd him up, and closely shut the door.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then loudly did the bold Sir Soulsby cry:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Ah! my Lord Mayor M'Arthur, dost thou go?</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall I not show my sorrow in my eyes?</div>
  <div class="i0">For now I see thy glorious time is dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">When every morning brought some famous scheme,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every scheme resulted in success.</div>
  <div class="i0">Such time hath not been since I first became,</div>
  <div class="i0">A sort of fixture in the Mansion House.</div>
  <div class="i0">But now thy term of office hath expired,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I no longer serving thee, must stay</div>
  <div class="i0">To travail 'mong new faces, other minds."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Slowly M'Arthur answer'd from the coach:</div>
  <div class="i0">"The old Mayor changeth, yielding place to new,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lest one good citizen have all the fun.</div>
  <div class="i0">Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?</div>
  <div class="i0">My reign is o'er, nor may it do thee harm</div>
  <div class="i0">If thou dost never see my face again.</div>
  <div class="i0">But now farewell. I am going a long way</div>
  <div class="i0">With these thou see'st&mdash;if, indeed, we can</div>
  <div class="i0">(For narrow and becrowded is the route)&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Before the new Lord Mayor to Westminster,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where many worthies are awaiting us;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thence the brave Show must citywards return</div>
  <div class="i0">To be dissolved at the famed Guildhall,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I at length in limbo shall repose&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Limbo of Aldermen who've passed the chair."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">So said he; and the gallant coach-and-four</div>
  <div class="i0">Moved off, like some prodigious equipage</div>
  <div class="i0">That seems quite natural in pantomime,</div>
  <div class="i0">But strange in real life. Sir Soulsby stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Long meditating, till the gold cock'd hats</div>
  <div class="i0">Those lackeys wore, looked like a single spark,</div>
  <div class="i0">And down Cheapside the cheering died away.</div>

<p>The plot of the Idyll, "Gareth and Lynnette,"
was given, in burlesque style, by Mr. Martin
Wood in "The Bath and Cheltenham Gazette"
shortly after the appearance of the original.</p>

<p>"The Quest of the Holy Poker," a parody in
blank verse appeared in <em>Punch</em>, March 5, 1870.</p>

<p>Three long Idyllic parodies, entitled "Willie
and Minnie" appeared in <em>Kottabos</em>, a Trinity
College magazine, published in Dublin by Mr.
W. McGee, in 1876.</p>

<p><em>The St. Paul's Magazine</em> of January, 1872, contained
a most amusing political Idyll, entitled
"<em>The Latest Tournament</em>"&mdash;an Idyll of the Queen
(respectfully inscribed to Alfred Tennyson, Esq.,
Poet Laureate). This parody, which consists
of nearly 400 lines, describes, in a mock-heroic
style, all the principal political celebrities of the
day, its satire being aimed at the supposed
Republican tendencies of the Liberal party.</p>

<p>"The Prince's Noses," a modern Idyll, by
W. J. Linton, a parody of Tennyson's blank
verse, appeared in <em>Scribner's Monthly Magazine</em>,
April, 1880.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em>, May 27, 1882, contained a poem
entitled "On the Hill; or, Tennysonian Fragments,
picked up near the Grand Stand." This
was an imitation of style only.</p>

<p>"Tory Revels" (<em>slightly altered from Tennyson</em>)
in <em>Punch</em>, August 26, 1882, commenced thus:&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>The Wheel World</em>, October, 1882, contained a
long parody, entitled "London to Leicester; a
Bicycling Idyl, by Talfred Ennyson (Poet
Laureate to the Mental Wanderers, B.C.)"
This is written in very blank verse, and is
chiefly interesting to 'Cyclists.</p>

<p><em>Pastime</em>, June 29, 1883, contained "T<span class="smcapa">ENNIS</span>, a
Fragment of the Lost Tennisiad," and July 27,
1883, "The Lay of the Seventh Tournament,"
both being parodies of Tennyson's "Idylls of
the King."</p>

<p>The small detached poems which Lord
Tennyson has written for the magazines of
late years, have been the cause of numerous
and very unflattering parodies.</p>

<p>The following "Prefatory Poem," by Alfred
Tennyson, appeared in the first number of the
"Nineteenth Century," published in March, 1877,
by Messrs. Henry S. King and Co., London:&mdash;</p>

the author of 'The Last Hat' is the plagiarist, I leave others

<p><em>The Nineteenth Century</em> for November, 1881,
contained a very uncomfortable kind of poem,
by Tennyson, entitled "D<span class="smcapa">ESPAIR</span>, a Dramatic
Monologue." The argument of the poem was
that "a man and his wife having lost faith in a
God, and hope of a life to come, and being
utterly miserable in this, resolve to end themselves
by drowning. The woman is drowned,
but the man is rescued by a minister of the sect
he had abandoned."</p>

<p><em>The Fortnightly Review</em> of the following month
contained a parody which not only turned inside
out the arguments of the original poem, but was
so exquisitely worded as a burlesque that it
was by many attributed to the pen of no less a
poet than Mr. A. C. Swinburne.</p>

<p>There still remain a great many parodies of
Tennyson's poems to be quoted, and every day
increases their number. It will, therefore, be
necessary to return to this author in some future
part of this collection; the following references
are given to some of the more easily accessible
parodies, which space will not now permit me to
quote in full:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Edinburgh Sketches and Miscellanies." By
Eric. Edinburgh and Glasgow: John Menzies
and Company, 1876, contains <em>Codger's Hall</em>,
a long and humorous parody of <em>Locksley Hall;</em>
Once a Week, Echoes from the Clubs, and The
Weekly Dispatch, October 19, 1884, also contained
parodies of the same poem.</p>

<p><em>Lady Clara Vere de Vere</em> was the subject of an
advertising parody, of which the best verse
ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Lady Clara Vere de Vere,</div>
  <div class="i0">You put strange fancies in my head!</div>
  <div class="i0">Do you remember that rich silk</div>
  <div class="i1">You wore last year at Maidenhead?</div>
  <div class="i1">Now "velveteen" is all the go;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis richer far, and costs much less,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lion on your old stone gates</div>
  <div class="i1">Is not more ancient than that dress."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>whilst the Charge of the Light Brigade was
thus imitated by a Birmingham tea-dealer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Half a League! Half a League!</div>
  <div class="i0">Half a League, onward!</div>
  <div class="i0">Into Gant's tea shop</div>
  <div class="i4">Walk many hundred.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tea is the people's cry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which is the kind to buy?</div>
  <div class="i0">Gant's at Two Shillings try,</div>
  <div class="i4">Say many hundred!</div>
  <div class="i0">Tea-men to right of us,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tea-men to left of us,</div>
  <div class="i0">Grocers all round us,</div>
  <div class="i4">Find they have blundered."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was another parody on the Charge of the
Light Brigade, in <em>Punch</em>, December 19, 1868.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Song of the 'Skyed' one, as sung at
the Academy on the first Monday in May," was
a parody, in ten verses, commencing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A<span class="smcapa">WAKE</span> I must, and early, a proceeding that I hate,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cab it to Trafalgar Square, and ascertain my fate;</div>
  <div class="i0">For to-morrow's the Art-Derby, the looked-for opening day</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the Fine Art Exhibition, yearly shown by the R.A.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This appeared in <em>Punch</em>, May 11, 1861.</p>

<p><em>The May Queen</em> was also imitated in a poem
contained in <em>Modern Society</em>, March 29, 1884. It
was entitled "Baron Honour," and was a very
severe, and rather vulgar, skit on Lord Tennyson's
adulation of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>In <em>The Weekly Dispatch</em>, September 9, 1883,
five parodies were printed in a competition to
anticipate the Poet Laureate's expected poem
in commemoration of the late John Brown; a
subject on which, however, Lord Tennyson has
not as yet published a poem. In the same newspaper
six parodies of <em>Hands All Round</em> were
inserted on April 2, 1882.</p>

<p>These were very entertaining, and were
severally entitled: "Pots all Round;" "Tennysonian
Toryism Developed;" "Drinks all
Round;" "Cheers all Round;" "Hands all
Round (with the mask off)"; and "Howls all
Round."</p>

<p><em>Truth</em>, February 14, 1884, contained a parody
entitled "In Memoriam; a Collie Dog." <em>Punch</em>
also had a parody with the title "In Memoriam"
on July 9, 1864.</p>

<p>"The Two Voices, as heard by Jones of the
Treasury about Vacation time," was the title of
a long parody in <em>Punch</em>, September 7, 1861.</p>

<p>There was also a political parody, on the same
original, in <em>Punch</em>, May 11, 1878.</p>

<p>"Recollections of the Stock Exchange," a
long parody of <em>Recollections of the Arabian Nights</em>,
and dealing with the topic of Turkish Stocks,
appeared in <em>Punch</em>, December 18, 1875.</p>

<p>"The Duchess's Song," after Tennyson, was
in <em>Punch</em>, September 3, 1881; and <em>British Birds</em>,
by Mortimer Collins (1878), contained, amongst
others, a capital parody of Tennyson.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
